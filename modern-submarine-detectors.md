## Muon Detection Based Naval Surveillance Systems

Place panels of muon detectors held down by concrete slabs, and affix them to the bottom of the ocean, or bury them in the seabed, to form a long grid or a wall of detectors, over miles of ocean floor. Retrieve the data from those detectors via cellular network connectivity with an appropriate base station antenna, and power those underwater detectors with batteries recharged by using any of the following options: 

- Conversion of mechanical movement of water waves and tides into electrical energy 

  - Triboelectric generators - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuVKRhRMogY 

  - Small tidal turbines that only power the detectors' transceiver antennae, which require few milliamperes or milliwatts per hour - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-2TyKqP84o 
  
Few months of data collected using muon tomography would provide a standard view of the volume of water above those detectors, and then, when a submarine or a ship with nuclear warheads were to trespass into that envelope, the deflection of muons from the cladding of those warheads would be noticeable.  

Combine the image from the panel of muon detectors arranged in a way to create a synthetic aperture radar, with other remote sensing techniques to obtain detailed view of sea vessels. 

Building and calibrating such a technology solution is likely to require a concentrated and concerted effort, carried out over many years in research and development, which must commence at the earliest. This is because, such systems are urgently needed to counteract the American, British, and Chinese naval vessels that have "meta-material" based coatings to deflect radar as well as sonar. 

Those Navies have started to "wrap" their submarines and ships with meta-materials to cleverly deflect sonar and radar around their naval vessels, in order to improve the stealthiness of their ships and submarines. But, those meta-materials still cannot interact with gamma rays and muons, the way the cladding enclosing nuclear reactors and warheads can deflect the natural stream of muons passing through earth. Identifying that disruption or disturbance within the constant stream of cosmic muons passing through earth, on a grid of detectors on the ocean floor or seabed, would reveal the otherwise stealthy naval vessels encroaching upon India's sovereign territories.
