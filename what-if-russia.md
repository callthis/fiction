# What-if scenarios
## What if Russia were to invade Ukraine and other EU countries 

Case studies help evaluate things in retrospect. What available analytical methods can be used for prospecting ideas towards building lifelines, capacity and resilience, before it is too late?

This is where the use of speculative or "what-if" scenarios come in handy.

What type of what-if scenarios might be relevant to current developments in Europe that have signaled a monumental shift in global diplomacy and economic trade developments, compared to the recent two decades? 

Let's look at one such as, "what-if hundreds of thousands of soldiers from Russia and its allies like China, were to erect barricades along Arctic coastlines, using their convenient rationales about needing to protect their 'sovereign' interests against incursions from medium and long range missiles of NATO?" The Russian government under the incumbency of Vladamir Putin has used exactly this style of reasoning while setting up camp next to Ukraine, and other balkan states that have deep seaports in the Black Sea. They wouldn't go ahead and plan to invade Canada with those kinds of reasons now, would they? 

Russians ~~haven't yet invaded Ukraine or taken~~ have already invaded Ukraine as of 25th February, 2022 to fully occupy Crimea, and to take over the seaports in Black Sea that they so desperately want and need. And how important can ports in the Black Sea be for Russia compared to ones on either coasts of Canada in the Atlantic and Pacific, as well as any possible new ones in the Hudson Bay area?"

Let's look at the logistics of the ongoing war in Ukraine, from an engineering economics perspective for the Russian side and then the EU+NATO side. 
When Russian troops have sought to occupy a region during the recent decades, they have first looked for staging grounds like: 
  - The Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions when invading Georgia, 
  - Crimea, and southern Belarus, along with Donetsk and Luhansk regions when invading Ukraine  

In each of those regions, the Russian legalist and diplomatic narrative was that as a sovereign nation, it was securing the interests of people who were ethnographically or historically Russian, or that it was lending military support to an autonomous region for helping people of that region, who on their own accord, already wanted to join a modern Russian federation. 

The Russian troops entered those types of regions adjacent to existing borders of Russia, only after a sufficient build up of insurgent forces within those regions that helped Russian troops secure parts of existing telecommunications, transportation and energy supply lines along with various human resources needed in further bureaucratic and military plans via positions in those regions. Within this strategy, the key tipping point has typically been Russia's recognition of "independent states that wanted to break free from oppressive or failed countries." Such a coup was a signal for Russian troops to advance and stage their artillery, medical and mobile launch sites within the region that wanted to supposedly "break free and join the Russian protectorate."

When Russia provides this type of a narrative, it compares its current strategies to those used by NATO, UK and the US throughout history, and consequently says that it isn't doing anything different than other blocs that have sought to establish forward bases within favorable client states or conquered puppet states. So the current Russian government's rationale is that it shouldn't be painted as the "bad guy" if all it is doing is continuing the anthropological tradition of a richer, more powerful state, annexing poorer, less powerful regions using only as much bloodshed and violence as necessary. Sadly, that is indeed the rationale of every country that reaches a particularly sizable economy and population where all it can see in its evolution, is a path to greater riches and global influence by gobbling up parts of the world. And the level of bloodshed and violence always becomes unbound and completely unnecessary on all fronts. 

How might EU and NATO even reach the battlefield now that it is too late for them to start marching? The EU has decided, on 28th February, 2022 to fund, procure, and supply armaments to Ukraine. Uh… from whom? And that too late into a full scale war? 

The one country with excess funds is Germany and its closest EU trade partners. And the only country with an overflowing supply of weapons is the US, and not even the UK, France, or Italy. So money is going to be sloshed around and then US cargo airplanes will dump weapons in Ukraine to ward off Putin, the way France did in Libya to oust Gadafi? Yes, pretty much.

And perhaps there will be the usual air support from the US the same way wars in Kosovo, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan and Mali have gone in the past three decades. But those wars never went well for the people within those regions. Indeed, the logistical maneuvers via airways for the US and its allies into any war always seem carefree and easy. After full aerial dominance, and thorough carpet bombing of all possible moving things on the ground, US led troops land to do a more intricately planned offensive. But this time around, the likelihood of an aerial assault to secure landings within the battlezones seems a bit more precarious. 

Is it just a little bit more precarious? No. It is almost close to impossible for US led troops to achieve air superiority and full electronic jamming capabilities because of Russian satellite and aerial counter-attack weapons with heavily armed and extremely eager, if not well trained, pilots and ground support units. The size of the Russian army is already much larger than what the US had managed to cobble together during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of the past two decades. 

The US and its allies are far too late to figure out how to ingress into the current war zones in Ukraine, and have yet to even figure out where to stage their troops. So they might want to now start an offensive from, let's say, um… from Germany? 

Oh hell no! Germany is not at all interested in having the same-old-same-old escapades with German troops advancing into Poland and Ukraine. 

So anywhere else in western Europe, some place west of the so-called 1991 arrangements between Europe and Russia that can be used for a d-day? 

Nope! Don't even think about that or ever dare to mention something like that!

So that leaves places like Check Republic, Moldova and other such countries that cannot choose to defy their overlords during the currently developing military escalations in that part of the world. Those poor countries, it seems, only exist for the sake of being ground down by all sides neighboring their borders. Since Russian military strategies seem to have already taken this possibility into account, they are counting on NATO and the US to become desperate enough, to allow their troops as well as armaments to be staged from countries just west and south of Ukraine. The Russians can then be able to use that as an excuse to advance all the way towards fields in Moldova by completely trampling Ukraine. 

It seems that every which way this war goes, the Ukrainians are going to have to put up a brave face while they get slaughtered because they weren't even the second class citizens of EU and of NATO, which is why they never received sufficient military aid in the form of troops. If there aren't sufficiently well trained soldiers, already positioned in Ukraine, what will happen to the weapons dumped all over the borders neighboring Russia? Yes, all those weapons will be grabbed by Russian soldiers. 

Russia hasn't even launched its advanced tactical and aerial reconnaissance units yet, Russia is still sending its expendable ruffians into Ukraine dressed up as regularized soldiers to act as bullet absorbents. The much more advanced war would start when the naval and aerial units of western alliances launch against Russian troops from the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Gulf of Arabia. 

Do you now see how that would readily escalate into a World War situation because of war zones erupting all across the regions with diagonals spanning from Finland in the North-West to Oman in the South-East, and Morocco in the South-West to the Russian shores of Laptev Sea in the North-East? 

And there isn't anyone covering the Russian front around the Laptev Sea. But there is when the US is likely to, almost certainly will, subdue Canada into giving up regions around its Arctic shores for staging mobile launch vehicles.    

So, how might the Russian military respond to the activities around Canadian Arctic shores? Russia certainly has no ally like Belarus around North America, nor does it have any convenient regions within Canada to start a coup for staging its industrial and military maneuvers, to then take over regions within North America once it ravages the Black Sea. Which means there is no reason for Russia to not simply strike sites within Canada where any troops might start to build up strength against the Russian front along the Arctic seas.

So then the US may try to attack Northern Russia via Japan? No, Japan is too busy dealing with Covid and it cannot afford wars from Europe to yet again spill over into Japan, especially if it means directly stepping on the toes of China for allowing fighter jets to launch from Japanese bases towards Russian submarine pens in the Arctic while flying over China.  

And if anybody takes this war to the outer reaches of earth's atmosphere into space, by attacking any satellite, all satellites will suffer from the fallout and debris of destroyed space vehicles. That will directly and instantaneously escalate into a full-scale World War.    

Indeed, no matter how much the EU and NATO allies, or even other groups of countries in the world try to pressure Russia into scaling back its military campaigns, it is now too late. 

The Russian military is steadily ramping momentum towards full scale seizure and occupation of several parts of Ukraine. And the EU can only hope to stop Russia by completely sacrificing Crimea. After that, once Russian armies simmer down, the EU and NATO can use Turkey to remain as the gatekeeper of the Bosphorus and prevent Russian naval excursions into the Agean and Mediterranean Seas in the coming years. 

But "old school" Russian strategists aren't likely to be so easily pacified, or cordoned, are they? This time around they are fully prepared for an all-out-war with the whole of the EU, and the US along with their NATO allies, especially against all barricades around the Bosphorus canal. 

The Russians knew perfectly well that their monetary assets would be frozen and they would face considerably harsh economic censure, in practically being ostracized from all economic and industrial activities concerning the EU and NATO. But they have enough of a war chest to simply keep hammering Ukraine till everyone on the planet agrees to let go of Crimea without any future hindrance to supplies of water, food, monetary, and human resources to Russian presence within Crimea. 

After that, it would be a cloaked stab against EU and NATO, if Turkey suddenly turned out to become pals with Russia, to conveniently let Russian submarines, aircraft-carriers and destroyers effuse out into the Mediterranean via the Bospherous canal, simply because Turkey didn't want to be treated as the poor beggar at EU's doorsteps. The Gulf Nations might benefit from such an outcome and might support it actively or passively. And since a multipolar world is in favor of countries like India, China and Brazil, they just might stay "neutral" in such matters to support the weakening of NATO's influence in global affairs, via passive-aggressive absenteeism during key talks and turning points. 

Countries like China and India have a lot more to gain from exploiting regions like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. And the conquest of Central Asia along the regions south of Urals, as well as the regions surrounding Caspian and Aral Seas is too lucrative to let the British and Americans use their age-old tactics to establish military bases in those regions in the name of "peacekeeping missions." 

The new-age greed of "emerging economies" isn't any different than the age-old greed of colonialists and imperialists, that is why there is no more shame left in the world against brazen warfare for devouring any and every resource that can be "monetized." The world is still stuck in a *free-for-all-no-holds-bar-zero-sum-game-winner-takes-all, death-match* that greedy militaristic leaders among various countries understand all too well. 

Any country that denies this aspect of the current global situation of humanity, has already been pwned and made to become a pacifist dullard, with mittens, blinders and earmuffs keeping them cozy in their subservient state.    

Within this type of a world, what makes you, or anyone else think that the Russians will spare parts of Canadian territories that can be used as staging grounds for American, British, Norwegian and Finnish militaries for attacks against Russian campaigns via Arctic routes?

Do you now understand why Russian submarines have been sitting around in the Arctic for more than two years, closer to Canadian shorelines, equipped with ballistic missiles and their brand new thermo-nuclear torpedoes? 

So when might Russia play its military cards against North America? When North America has too many wildfires to put out along the Pacific coast and the US-Canada Pinetree lines; and while droughts sap the rest of American southern and south western regions; along with newer, more lethal fungal spores that blight wheat and other grain crops throughout the US and Canada.
