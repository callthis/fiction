## Money Does Not Help Me Stay Dead

>Neither has fame, status, power, or anything else helped me stay dead. 

Once upon a time I was a king, and my subjects would ask me about currency, about money, and about the nature of things that were meant to be *"fungible."* 

My way of showing approbation for things that could be exchanged for equivalent value of gold ingots, was to touch that physical thing, with my right index finger, to indicate that as a particularly finite and tangible thing, the item I had touched, could also be used as currency in place of gold, within my kingdom's economy. 

Funny as it may sound, now that I am back on Earth, I have come to learn the bastardized version of my life's story. People these days have contorted my rules and regulations, to say that anything I used to touch, "would become gold." I should like to correct them, and let them know that I never had the magical power of Alchemy, that too, I certainly did not have the ability to turn things into gold by merely touching those things. I can assure you, no being on Earth has ever had that type of an alchemist's or a magician's trait.  

People these days say that I had touched my daughter with my hand and as a consequence of that, every manner of flesh became a commodity. Supposedly, if even a king's daughter could be used as a token or as a bargaining chip, instead of some type of coins or promissory notes, then certainly, all other human beings and animal flesh could also be bought and sold, in a marketplace. 

I have also come to learn about a story of another king's daughter called Draupadi, who was placed as a wager in a game of chance. It is tragic to see that people have not yet derived any worthwhile lessons from those mystical tales and mythical folklore. Worse, those ignorant and ignoble people are still risking the lives of their kith and kin, through gambling for money and property. 

I should like to clarify that I had never intended to promote or propagate slavery, I still find it repugnant and reviling. One should know that a human being has the rightful ability to breath clean air and live freely, only by the permission and authority of The Supreme Lord â€” The Owner of The Judgment Day. 

Neither is it correct for me or for any other person, to take away that breath or to harass that life by using any type of force, nor is it correct to assert ownership over someone's life to treat them as a chattel. I have never owned my life for that matter, and that is because, my life belongs to The One and Only Creator of The Universe. It is for this reason, that the life imbued within a body that I happen to inhabit, is only in the service of The Ultimate and Supreme God of all that is and isn't. 

And yet, my subjects ran afoul of my ordinances and of The Laws of The Realm. Pathetic and sad, isn't it? 

Previously, I had even tried to hide my burial site, within an array of burial mounds and pyramids in Anatolia. I had ordered that my coffin and burial chamber not be set in the middle of the mound, so that grave robbers plumbing for treasure at the middle of a supposed burial site, would not be able to find my grave to defile and plunder it. More importantly, I had gone to such troubles to hide my grave so that when I had died, and had been suitably laid to rest, it was my hope that people would not be able to find my dead body to use it as a trinket, or as a relic, or as a shrine, by embalming any part of my dead remains. 

It is truly unlawful to desecrate or to defile a dead body, it is indeed unlawful and utterly wrong to use a dead body or any part of a deceased human being, as a commodity or as a religious relic or as a piece of collateral property. The dead body must be returned to Earth, with honour and dignity. 

The whole of a dead body, or organs from a dead body that are "donated" in the name of science for the good of society, by the liberal will and wish of a sane person, is a gift for science that should not be taken undue advantage of, by petty people. Autopsy of a dead body, conducted by a competent and proper coroner for the purposes of forensics, is lawful. However, many countries and nations in current day and age do not seem to understand The Basic and Foundational Law, that prohibits and proscribes anyone from tampering with a dead body. 

This is why, the cost of rites and rituals for appropriately returning a dead body to Earth, must be taken up by the family's estate or by the city's municipality for the good of the community in a satisfactory manner. 

Any society which disobeys and violates The Sacred Laws of The Realm, will be demolished and thoroughly destroyed via Divine Retribution. 

It is of course difficult for me to explain to you that experiencing death countless times still does not make me immortal. And it is truly a bane to land here after dying and not be able to rest in Eternal Peace, for all those of us who still have unfinished business, in this mortal realm. 

Kings and Queens or other such despots are not needed anymore by humanity. So, if there is one personal favour you can do for me, please do this: try not to commit a foul against my dead flesh and bones should you ever find my body in a lifeless state. And also, please let people know that I never had donkey's ears, I was never tone deaf and have always had a profound appreciation for music and the arts, and for astronomy.
