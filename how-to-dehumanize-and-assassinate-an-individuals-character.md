## How To Dehumanize and Assassinate, An Individual's Character 

When state-sponsored antagonists and aggressors don't have any legitimate way to criminalize targeted individuals, they tend to resort to political abuse of psychology and psychiatry, by maliciously asserting that the targeted individual has "personality disorder." Such a disorder need not be diagnosed or proven, based on any type of <ins>physiological</ins> tests. Pathologizing an individual or an entire community, can be done via simple assertions about their demeanor and tendencies, based on "expert opinions" of psychologists, and of any, arbitrary authority figures. 

Often, it is sufficient to merely have a few "experts and witnesses", on the side of state-authorized groups, to collectively assert that the targeted community's member is unruly, boastful, disagreeable, not amenable to main-stream cultural etiquette, or, "unmanageable due to behavioral 'issues.'" After that, any number of state-sponsored mechanisms can be directed at doing legalized forms of visceral and pernicious harms, against the profiled and targeted people, using the guise of psychological or psychiatric treatment for the ascribed disorder. 

Of course, if those so-called experts were to be asked whether they have studied any of the recent publications on standards of American Psychological Association (APA), for eliminating racist views about personality and personhood from modern sciences, they will most probably evade the question or simply say that they haven't. If those conniving experts, doctors, and authority figures are then asked, if they can tell the difference between an individual's personality, and character, they typically won't be able to. This is because their objective was to assassinate and tarnish the character of the targeted individual, by casting aspersion on the person's honor, dignity, upbringing, aesthetic appearance, and morals. 

When the so-called experts are further questioned about their expertise, by having them showcase the model of personality constructs they used, in evaluating or profiling the targeted person, they will usually be at a loss for words and explanations, because they can't tell you what the phrase, "personality constructs", is supposed to mean. 

Sometimes, an agency hires a *"profiler",* who will claim that they happened to observe the target individual's behaviors and attitude, to create a profile of that individual's characteristic "temperament", based on either a: 
 
 - [5-traits model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), or, 
 
 - [6-factors model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEXACO_model_of_personality_structure), or,
 
 - [16-types model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator),  
 
 - and the list of [tests pertaining to personality constructs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tests#Personality_tests) goes on.[^1] 

Traits, types, factors, features, facets, attributes, and all other synonymous words used for describing components of human personality, are called personality constructs. They are used for describing the presumed things within a human being's soul, or mind, that astrologers like to ascribe to star signs. Such constructs are used for describing a collection of behaviors exhibited by a human being in various situations, with the assumption that these constructs are intrinsic, or inherent, to the person, and are stable throughout the person's biological development, regardless of the experiences and education the person has been through, or will ever go through. The profile created by a hired profiler, can then be used as a "legal basis" for casting suspicion on the targeted individual's morality and ethical code of conduct. Doing so, is sufficient to direct further surveillance and investigative resources, "to nail the 'suspect.'" 

By attributing bad behaviors, attitudes and personality features to a person, which are supposedly "symptoms" of mental disorders, or of moral shortcomings and character flaws, or of spiritual ailments, the targeted person can be made to seem like a lesser being. It then becomes easier for wrongdoers to suppress their own conscience and scruples, to injure and to do harmful things, to a dehumanized animal.  

Current day profiling methods in ethnography, based on pop-science and racist views of psychology, are no better than [phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology#Application) and astrology. Current profiling methods take their origin from antiquity, when explaining biology or human behavior using folklore and mythology, was the only established standard, because the concept of science hadn't come into existence. In fact, till date, pseudo-scientists haven't been able to decide whether sleepiness versus wakefulness among human beings, is strictly a biological phenomenon, or a personality trait, or whether it is somehow related to birthdays and planetary alignments. The following link provides tables that compare models for describing "good versus bad" personality traits, spanning centuries of human history -

It is no surprise, that when state-sponsored agents decidedly take action, for hunting down and capturing marginalized human beings, as per their orders, or for sport, they pretend to be objective and rational in the public's eye, only to disguise their discriminatory prejudices and hypocrisies, with scientific lingo and an air of authority. 

[^1]: It is plainly observable that all such personality tests are from Western countries, and that many of them were developed for and by the Nazis, or for and by the Anglo-American forces, during and after the World Wars, to serve the socio-political purposes of those respective camps.
