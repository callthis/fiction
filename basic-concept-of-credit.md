## Basic Concept of Credit 

<br>  

>*Surely, this online article is entirely about a fictitious and an imaginary concept called credit, isn't it?*  

<br>  

There are only pre-paid, pay-on-delivery, and post-paid forms of financial models, applicable to any given business transaction. Pre-paid and post-paid financial models necessarily generate a form of credit, that is given from one party to another, because of the business transaction linking those parties together in a financial situation that involves uncertainty or information-asymmetry. 

Suppose person M is the vendor, of any products or services (i.e. material goods), and person Q is the buyer:

- If M sells material goods to Q on a post-paid financial model using a proper invoice, then M has given an amount of credit as well as the sold goods to Q, by investing trust in Q on the faithful belief and basis that Q will not run away with those goods, and will honorably pay M in consideration for having received those goods, as per the promise of the *fair* terms and conditions in the agreed upon and transacted invoice. 

- If M is yet to deliver the material goods sold to Q, on a pre-paid financial model using a contract, then Q gives an amount of credit as well as cash (or cash equivalents) to M, by investing trust in M on the faithful belief and basis that M will not run away with that given money, and will honorably provide the promised goods to Q in accordance to the *fair* terms and conditions of the agreed upon and transacted contract. 

Indeed, invoices are contracts. And who-so-ever invests ***[trust](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/docs/01-02-03.md#123-trust-and-reliance)*** in a person or a system, under the conditions of uncertainty or information-asymmetry, gives credit to that other person or a system, by virtue of having to handle the risk of loosing the invested trust and equity. That type of potential loss, or opportunity cost, is typically incurred by the Creditor because of time and market based risks in a business or a social scenario. Typically, the credit given by a Creditor is in the form of a verbal promise, a loan, a contractual document ensuring credit-worthiness, a cash advance, or a collateral item that is too often undervalued though stated as being on par with the value of the social credibility and trust gained by a person receiving credit. Thus, "credit" is a measure and a record of the invested socio-economic vector called trust, in a time-bound and an honor-bound business transaction.  

An entity in the form of a corporation or an association of persons or a constituted body (including a government backed custodian system, a scheme, or a program), that is in the business of regularly or frequently giving a cash advance, or a promissory note, or "a letter of recommendation or a certificate" ensuring credit-worthiness, to selected or qualified Consumers, via any retail channel, is an insurance company or a banking enterprise. Those insurance companies and banks, need to be regulated by a *competent and publicly accountable regulatory authority* using established statutory rules and laws, so as to protect Consumers, Trustees, and Creditors from a range of problems, prejudices, unfairness, injustices, and undue risks that can impact "market participants."  

**For example:**  

>Particular healthcare providers cheating Consumers by transacting unfairly-priced post-paid products and services, without invoices, particularly in the guise of pay-on-delivery goods, is an ongoing form of criminal abuse of innocent Consumers, that needs to be curtailed immediately.

As if, a South Asian person of color like me, having to suffer harms from discriminatory crimes and wrongful deeds committed by numerous Canadian public-service units and private corporations in Ontario Canada, wasn't painful enough, some of the Indian "duty-bound" public-service providers and "laudable" corporations in Ranga Reddy District of Hyderabad, Telangana, India, are truly insufferable!
