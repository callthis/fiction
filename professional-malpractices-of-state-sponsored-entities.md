## Professional Malpractices of State-Sponsored Entities

People who have obtained positions of power and privilege illegitimately, as well as those who have colonialist mentality, keep finding ways to test how much abuse you are willing to put up with, what you are willing to sacrifice, and how much you are willing to suffer before you even manage to speak up. They test your "triggers" and "breaking points", by constantly ramping up the different forms of hurt and pain they can inflict upon you. In this way, they are also able to test the kinds of morally dubious and ethically questionable things they can get away with. 

Until you push back, until you stand up for yourself, they will keep knocking you down. 

Of course, when you do stand up for yourself, they find convenient ways of washing their hands off of their duty to properly resolve the problematic issues they've created. Following that, they find much more cunning ways to continuously attack you with intentions of causing psychological hurt and social distress, using any range of remarks about your body, intellect, and cultural outlook, or by insinuating that you are:

- an oversensitive snowflake, 

- a jaded person who talks back rudely,

- a disrespectful person with an attitude problem, 

- a rotten and spoiled brat who undeservedly keeps wanting things, 

- an immature child who throws tantrums at being upset about inconsequential things, 

- a no-good slacker who is a burden, 

- an ill-tempered, bad-mannered shabby person, with *unrefined* character,

- a stuck up snob with flawed personality traits, 

- a jailbird who is unfit for membership in any august society,

- a deviant wreck with spiritual or character defects,

- an overzealous, manic, obsessive buffoon, 

- a malevolent, shifty-eyed trickster, 

- an impostor pretending to be on the side of good against evil,

- a roguish recalcitrant, 

- a hater who is envious or jealous of people in a better position, 

- a person with anger management issues, 

- a disgruntled or jaded person who cannot be reasoned with,

- a junkie or a thrill seeker who can't evaluate actual risks and dangers, 

- a gold-digger or a money-pincher, 

- a daydreamer in denial of "reality",  

- a filthy piece of deadwood,

- or, a mad and irrational, mentally sick person. 

When their ignorance, arrogance, pretentiousness, and enervating bigotry is pointed out to them, they have a way of rationalizing their wretched behaviors to say that they were only working towards preserving the 'best interests' of some abstract goals, based on the 'available information' they had at the time, and within the bounds of 'reasonable assumptions' they formulated using what they 'felt' was right and truthful. That is the manner in which they remain intolerant and xenophobic towards people who are not akin to their "own image." 

Much more cleverly, they tend to use the phrase "ad homonym arguments", as a label to conveniently dismiss write ups such as this blog article's style and content, to suggest that any mention of political conflicts in any type of a discussion is only 'drama', which is bound to be unhelpful for bringing about positive changes in society, due to potential conflagrations that it can bring about, and therefore, must be excluded from the sociological enterprise known as "science." As is typical, they also like to claim monopoly over what science is or isn't, for the purposes of cultural dominance via subterfuge.[^1] 

I must include my personal opinions and experiences from a realist's perspective in such writings, which do not deny or deflect the significant consequences of local and global socio-political conflicts in a human being's daily life. I can understand why, socio-political factors impacting all the available options for paid work, accessible living quarters within a city, social exchanges, professional experiences requiring equitable treatment, as well as all other things that impact people's quality of life, happen to be *a set of truths,* that need to be excluded from scientific journals and technical manuals, especially for readers who need a "purified" and "attenuated" version of readily observable truths. 

However, after reading through scores of entries from the ["Pew Biomedical Scholars - Oral History Project Database",](https://digital.sciencehistory.org/collections/vjikmuc) which contains interviews of a number of scholars who produced a range of novel scientific expositions during the past century, the idea of divorcing those expositions from the human beings who had to put up with numerous betrayals and murderous onslaughts throughout their lives while producing honest work, seems unfair. The narratives of lived experiences of people who happen to work in an industry, need to be preserved somewhere, so that readers who don't want to struggle with the emotional burden of having to comprehend the day-to-day realities surrounding another human being's situation, can be content with reading plain scientific journals, and anybody else who wants to learn about the societal structures surrounding a person's life and work, can refer to curated repositories of that kind of historical knowledge. 

For without any knowledge about the day-to-day realities surrounding a person's life and work, all known expositions in science and arts would become lot less meaningful to those who care about context and precedence. But, for many professionals who have learned to keep their heads down, and to remain silent in the face of atrocities in order to survive predicaments thrust upon their mortal lives, the labor of expressing sympathy or empathy as a charity to others is reserved for a fixed duration of the day, neatly compartmentalized for when the technically savvy worker aiming for an enriching career path, watches movies or reads novels in their "free time." Somehow, for many of those types of professionals engaged in highly technical fields of study and work, behaving like an emotionally reticent person or an automaton, instead of simply being compassionate, is an affront to *militaristic utilitarianism* and "logical thinking." Militaristic utilitarianism devoid of human emotions, is supposedly, the only worthwhile approach to living that any person ought to pursue, due to such a utilitarian path's emphasis on achieving self-actualization, transcendence, and 'ultimate supremacy', via pseudo-religious maxims like, "mind over matter."  

So, you might as well ask those calculative clinicians and technicians who leave their human ability to sympathize and empathize at the coat rack, when they enter into "a business environment", a little more directly about what type of reasoning they had adopted in coming up with the assumptions they used, while causing you distress and harm during professional interactions with you and others around you? What exactly was happening in their thought process, when they willingly chose to repeatedly ignore your visible pain and suffering caused by their professional conduct, during their interactions with you and with other persons like yourself in their professional care? Did they use inductive or deductive reasoning and verifiable facts, to come up with their assumptions about your cultural and actual healthcare needs? Did they consider that pathologizing or criminalizing your faith, heritage, personhood, and character by using contrived and illegitimate pretexts, would only degrade the trustworthiness of their entire network of professional service providers?  

Upon asking the above types of questions, you will notice that they either <ins>do not understand</ins> what you mean by types of reasoning (such as inductive and deductive reasoning); or that they are genuinely insensitive or even downright sadistic. 

Over a period of time involving multiple incidents, you might eventually recognize the fact that they tend to use *abductive reasoning* with which, they first decided upon a result that they wanted to obtain from interacting with you, and thereafter, they make up reasons and assumptions which fit the preconceived, racially biased mental models they've continued to harbor about: who you are, what your role in society happens to be in their lord's "dominion" or "kingdom", what your role in society ought to be, what you were doing, what you could have been doing instead, and what your potential as well as actual "net worth to 'the realm'" could have ever been or can ever be.  

As such, behaviors perceived as: rudeness, arrogance, 'anger', vagrancy, disrespectful 'attitude', being 'disgraceful' or disagreeable, being 'ungrateful' or skeptical, having restlessness or 'malaise', or any type of outlook that can be termed as 'emotional residue' from 'embitterment', are labeled by colonialists as "symptoms of diseases", or as "bad personality traits", that arise from "poor upbringing, or inner daemons and accursed ailments." Such problematic rationales propagated by colonialism and racial sectarianism, have unfortunately remained embedded within legal frameworks concerning healthcare, safety, security, and educational standards for training and certifying public service workers in countries like Canada. 

**Worst of all:** 

- Sterilizing profiled people by causing those human beings reproductive and visceral harms, in the name of 'restoring sanity or sanitation', or in the guise of providing aid to 'restore peace, order, and justice', is Eugenics. It just so happens to be that, Eugenics based activities have been normalized and incorporated within organizational culture of public service units in countries like Canada, via institutionalized policies and practices, even though those kinds of cultural values, polices, and practices have always been staggeringly immoral and unethical. 

Lastly, I must add that the 'pejorative' tone of this write up, must not be confused with the physical act of airplanes being smashed into iconic high-rise buildings or defense facilities in North America. Nor is it the aim of this blog entry to give separatists and terror organizations any kind of propaganda material as ammo, for use in their geopolitical ambitions to replicate the Vatican's history using their chosen school of religion within their preferred city-state of the world. The simple aim of this and practically all of my non-fiction published work among such online repositories, is to have pretentious people like the leadership and management of Canada's public sector institutions as well as private organizations, take pause, and reflect on: 

- "How will members of Canadian main-stream societies manage to change their course and direction in this universe, from the bleak oblivion they are rapidly marching towards, without implementing actual remedies and paying punitive damages, for the international-scale harms and injuries they have continued to cause to persons of color and various [ethnic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contemporary_ethnic_groups)?" 

[^1]: Will you get to meet people during your lifetime, who are going to be more nuanced in their outlook, actions, and beliefs, and who are not going to be stuck with merely one simplistic, unchanging approach to life? Yes, most probably. And most probably, you already are one, or soon will be one of those contemplative people who can evaluate things from multiple perspectives, to take the next viable step in life, that will be worthwhile and will make you as well as people around you become better off in life, as opposed to becoming permanently stuck in a rut.
