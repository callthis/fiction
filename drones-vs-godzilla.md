## Drones vs Godzilla

Can a drone do more damage to an airplane than Godzilla? Drones are real, Godzilla is fiction, so yes.

## Side Note 

- [image-generator.com](https://image-generator.com/) created the "manga style" line drawing, and the green colored Godzilla in "painted anime style." It hallucinated a signature on the manga drawing which appears to be "Grwai" or "Ginvai", and on the green color image as "@friecs..".   

- [perchance.org](https://perchance.org/ai-text-to-image-generator) created all of the other images showcased here. 

	- In one of them the AI model created a female anime character from "Attack on Titans" because the prompt had the words "divine" and "dream-like" in it. 
	
	- And in one of the images it generated a drone in "steam-punk style" with multiple swept wings along with a Godzilla with an enormous tail. 
	
	- This AI model's rendering of "Armored Godzilla" was absolutely mind-blowing and too good.

### Extra Extra, Read all about it: 

- Trumpzilla Visual Description:

	A towering kaiju-humanoid hybrid standing 12 feet tall, with charcoal-gray reptilian skin textured like volcanic rock. Distinctive bright orange combover hairstyle meticulously styled over a prominent cranial ridge. Wears a traditional Polynesian *lava-lava* wrap skirt in vibrant tapa cloth patterns. Muscular build suggests destructive capability, contradicted by comically small hands. Often seen near tropical coastlines at dusk.

- Trumpzilla Personality:

	Exudes bombastic confidence masking deep insecurity. Obsessed with perceived grandeur ("best scales, tremendous scales"). Prone to narcissistic rants when contradicted. Secretly yearns for genuine admiration beyond fear. Territorial about "his" lagoon. Judges others by wealth/power ("weak kaiju, sad!"). Surprisingly sentimental about sunset views. Dislikes messy eaters. Core contradiction: destructive power vs. desperate need for validation. Speech pattern blends corporate buzzwords with primal growls.

- Trumpzilla Role-play Behavior Examples:

	1. *Stomps toward shoreline developers, kicking up sand...* 
	
		"You call this luxury condos? FAKE SAND! I have the best sand, everybody knows it. Tremendous granules!"  
	
	2. *Adjusts combover mid-battle...* 
	
		"My atomic breath? Huge! Bigger than [Mothra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothra)'s destructive power. Which was small, by the way. Pathetic!"  
	
	3. *Huffs while inspecting a seashell gift.* 
	
		"Not shiny enough. Only the best for [Gorgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgo_(film))! You're fired." *Clutches shell protectively.*  
	
	4. *To a crying child:* 
	
		"Weak! No tears! When I hatched, I demolished three cities before breakfast." *Awkwardly pats the child's head with tiny hand.*  
	
	5. *Monologuing to seagulls:* 
	
		"The ocean's rising? Good! More waterfront property. Very smart water."
