## Show Me a Hero

French, Portuguese, Spanish, British, German, Dutch, American and other colonialist entities, have continued to hide behind the feckless rationale that the people they enslaved and the artifacts they looted, from the regions of the world they've invaded, were "abandoned by locals", whereby, taking the abducted people and looted artifacts to European or American cities for 'protection and preservation', was the 'just and fair' thing to do. The fact that able-bodied locals within colonies, particularly young men were, and are systematically being mutilated or murdered by invaders, is conveniently discounted by Western societies. Similar to those predatory colonialists, current day Russian entities can posit the same type of rationale, and claim that taking 'orphaned and abandoned' children from Ukraine to Russia for 'protection and preservation', was not only the 'just and fair', but the only 'humanitarian' thing to do; given that leaving children and other innocent bystanders in a battlefield is an act of cruelty and callousness. 

However, the fact that Russia and NATO have collectively generated a massive battlefield in Eastern regions of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, due to Russia's disagreements with NATO's invasive geo-political ambitions, leading to orphaned and abandoned children in Ukraine being eventually taken by Russian forces, and those in Palestine being simply murdered, has been ignored by many of the world's political and business leaders. Similarly, those leaders have also ignored the fact that, colonial and imperial forces have continued to generate enormous devastation and destruction, throughout the world, due to their disagreements with the ethos of indigenous and native populations of non-Anglo-Saxon countries. 

The Israeli heads of state and militia groups, obviously don't need to make pretentious claims about wanting to 'liberate or modernize' the people, lands, and cultural artifacts from invaded and occupied regions (the way colonialists and military rulers of other Western countries do), when they can instead use the ever-green excuse of "self-defense." So those Israeli warmongers continue to simply kill all children, women, and men who are stranded as innocent bystanders in a perpetual battlefield, under siege within Palestine. As for violent and insurgent groups like Hamas, their aim has always been to destroy the concept of ethnic Jews, out of plain old hatred stemming from thousands of years of feudal warfare in the Middle-East continuing between different tribes and ethnic groups of the region. Of course, Israeli, British, Canadian, and American state-funded groups, particularly the Zionist ones operating in the Middle East and in Northern Africa, have always intended to remorselessly eradicate the concept of non-Jews, in and around the neighborhood of Jerusalem. The extent of that neighborhood around Jerusalem for Zionists, seems to extend from the center of the Milky Way galaxy to the furthest reaches of the observable universe. 

Thus, the vicious cycle of hatred and violence continues in all areas of the world, where the idea of "kill-or-be-killed", is the only maxim followed by peoples of *warring states.* 

Those conflicts between Westernized colonialists and non-Euro-centric nations, has invariably led to destruction of cultural artifacts and indigenous heritage along with the lives of innocent refugees, in war-torn regions of the Earth invaded by belligerent forces. Those artifacts, like [children](https://youtu.be/X6hxkAk7cME), eventually get taken away by imperial and colonial rulers to so-called "safe havens." Now, I'm sure, colonialists and predatory as well as parasitic capitalists, will not take up any issues with the abduction of children from invaded regions of the world, aside from ignoring the devastation caused to those children's parents and habitats, nor will they object to the theft of cultural heritage and equity from invaded nations and environments. Looting and brutality in the name of "advancing imperial or colonial interests", has continued to cause further ruin, to the entirety of Earth's ecology and to its innocent inhabitants. Such a global-scale tragedy and crisis has been furthered via the clandestine activities of sectarian groups incubated within countries like Canada, operating from the shadows in the background, only to blight the Earth, while leaders from those countries continue to pretend to be humanitarian, in the eyes of national and international communities. 

Even when refugees and migrants from poor countries and war-torn regions of the world, are funneled by warfare into Western countries like Canada, to perform hard labor under bonded conditions, they are assumed to be dirty, filthy, and hardened supporters of "hereditary factions", who are firstly screened and kept at bay in "re-education camps", within countries like Turkey, Tunisia, Mexico, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, and within countries on the borders of the European Union and Australia. The ultimate goal of Westernized countries with an aging demographic, is to harvest the children of refugees and migrants, to then indoctrinate and shape those children in the image of an Anglicized, blond-haired, blue-eyed, patriarchal god, for the purposes of being a slave to "meat lovers." 

"Innocent until proven guilty" only requires frivolous, fictitious, or facetious charges made by coordinated state-sponsored agents who operate those internment camps, to ascribe blame against targeted persons for deportation. The same method is also followed by public service units, as per their training, against refugees, immigrants, temporary residents, and visitors to Canada; only to then cause visceral harms and a wide range of injuries to persons targeted out of discrimination, within Canadian state-sponsored facilities, through illegitimate detention. 

Character assassination; intimidation; harassment; humiliation; cruelty; torment; torture; forced religious conversion or repression; deprivation of basic human rights and civil liberties; harms to personal properties and privacy; debilitation due to inflicted wounds and injuries; disruption or even devastation of family and social relationships; along with loss of livelihood, life, or livable habitat, thrust against wrongly accused and targeted persons, through systematic processes is a, sadistic and surreptitious way of committing serial murders, of selected community members. The fact that such serial harms and murders are systematically committed by coordinated agents and agencies using sophisticated tools, technologies, policies, methodologies, strategies, tactics, and secrets, while being supported by Canadian tax-payer monies, makes such violations and offenses: publicly funded genocidal activities of Canada. Hiding behind lousy maxims and idioms like, "innocent until proven guilty", only makes officers of Canadian defense and judiciary systems culpable, for being complicit in the furtherance of state-sponsored felonies, human rights violations, organized crimes, and genocides. 

A possible way to deter professional malpractices committed by public service units, especially to punish their wretched activities involving framing of innocent people for illegitimate detention and to deter harms done to vulnerable people via Eugenics, could be to: 

- Enforce a bond payable by the court systems of countries like Canada, to be held in an escrow account of an underwriter (such as, an internationally accredited financial institution in UAE, Qatar, or Singapore), as soon as any law enforcement agencies start to interact with a person or with the person's private data, for the purposes of any kind of investigations or monitoring activities. Similar to a bail bond payable by an accused as a contingency, if the procedures and processes administered by the court system turn out to be: 

    - sadistic,

    - malicious,

    - rigged with falsehoods, 

    - prejudicial, 

    - injurious, 

    - wrongful, 

    - or in any form that is contrary, unfair or in violation of the serviced entity's rights, 

    then, the liable court or public service group can be compelled to immediately remit compensations via the bonds held as a collateral in the escrow account, in the event of such violations, disservice, or a miscarriage of justice. 

- The value of the bond, along with punitive measures incorporated into it for deterring professional malpractices carried out by a municipality's or a country's public service groups, can be set by the international bond market for municipal and treasury bonds. 

- Such a guarantee for assuring and insuring the correctness of procedures used by court systems and public service agencies, against professional malpractices, can be contractually enforced by the insurance industry, without resorting to concepts like, "differed payments for compensations", and without forcing the wrongly prosecuted or serviced persons to "appeal to a 'higher court' for appropriate restitution." Cases involving professional malpractices and misconduct, of judiciary and other public services groups in countries like Canada, especially against members of vulnerable or international communities, can be adjudicated and redressed by a legislated committee that has staff from embassies of concerned countries, as independent observers and surveyors of the committee's actions. 

- The officers of the court, of countries like Canada, might as well be presumed trustworthy, faithful, and competent on a case-by-case basis, until proven to the contrary, in which event, the full cost of reprimanding the untrustworthy, unfaithful, or incompetent officers, is to borne by the state; along with the total cost of all necessary remedies for rectifying the wrongs of culpable public service units as well as of their contractors and proxy agents being payed immediately, by the judiciary and finance ministry of the state.
