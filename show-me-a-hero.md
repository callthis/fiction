## Show Me a Hero

French, Portuguese, Spanish, British, German, Dutch, American and other colonialist entities, have continued to hide behind the feckless rationale that the people they enslaved and the artifacts they looted, from the regions of the world they've invaded, were "abandoned by locals", whereby, taking the abducted people and looted artifacts to European or American cities for 'protection and preservation', was the 'just and fair' thing to do. Able-bodied locals within colonies and numerous ex-colonies like Serbia and Ethiopia, particularly young men, were, and are systematically being mutilated or murdered by invaders; of course, this fact has been, and is being conveniently discounted by leaders of Western societies. 

You may also note that, similar to those predatory colonialists, current day Russian entities can posit the same type of rationale, and claim that taking 'orphaned and abandoned' children from Ukraine to Russia for 'protection and preservation', was not only the 'just and fair', but the only 'humanitarian' thing to do; given that leaving children and other innocent bystanders in a battlefield is an act of cruelty and callousness. 

However, the plainly observable fact that Russia and NATO have collectively generated a massive battlefield in Eastern regions of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, due to Russia's disagreements with NATO's invasive geo-political ambitions, leading to orphaned and abandoned children in Ukraine being eventually taken by Russian forces, and those in Palestine being simply murdered, has also been ignored by many of the world's political and business leaders. Similarly, those leaders have also ignored the fact that, colonial and imperial forces have continued to generate enormous devastation and destruction, throughout the world, due to their disagreements with the ethos of indigenous and native populations of non-Anglo-Saxon countries. 

The Israeli heads of state and militia groups, obviously don't need to make pretentious claims about wanting to 'liberate or modernize' the people, lands, and cultural artifacts from invaded and occupied regions (the way colonialists and military rulers of other Western countries do), when they can instead use the ever-green excuse of "self-defense." So those Israeli warmongers continue to simply kill all children, women, and men who are stranded as innocent bystanders in a perpetual battlefield, under siege within Palestine. As for violent and insurgent groups like Hamas, their aim has always been to destroy the concept of ethnic Jews, out of plain old hatred stemming from thousands of years of feudal warfare in the Middle-East continuing between different tribes and ethnic groups of the region. Of course, Israeli, British, Canadian, and American state-funded groups, particularly the Zionist ones operating in the Middle East and in Northern Africa, have always intended to remorselessly eradicate the concept of non-Jews, in and around the neighborhood of Jerusalem. The extent of that neighborhood around Jerusalem for Zionists, seems to extend from the center of the Milky Way galaxy to the furthest reaches of the observable universe. 

Thus, the vicious cycle of hatred and violence continues in all areas of the world, where the idea of "kill-or-be-killed", is the only maxim followed by peoples of *warring states.* 

Those conflicts between Westernized colonialists and non-Euro-centric nations, have invariably led to destruction of cultural artifacts and indigenous heritage, along with the lives of innocent refugees being devastated by belligerent forces, in war-torn regions of the Earth. Those artifacts, like [children](https://youtu.be/X6hxkAk7cME), eventually get taken away by imperial and colonial rulers to so-called "safe havens." Now, I'm sure, colonialists and predatory as well as parasitic capitalists, will not take up any issues with the abduction of children from invaded regions of the world, aside from ignoring the devastation caused to those children's parents and habitats, nor will they object to the theft of cultural heritage and equity from invaded nations and environments. Looting and brutality in the name of "advancing imperial or colonial interests", has continued to cause further ruin, to the entirety of Earth's ecology and to its innocent inhabitants. Such a global-scale tragedy and crisis has been furthered via the clandestine activities of sectarian groups incubated within countries like Canada, operating from the shadows in the background, only to blight the Earth, while leaders from those countries continue to pretend to be humanitarian, in the eyes of national and international communities. 

Even when refugees and migrants from poor countries and war-torn regions of the world, are funneled by warfare into Western countries like Canada, to perform hard labor under bonded conditions, they are assumed to be dirty, filthy, and hardened supporters of "hereditary factions", who are firstly screened and kept at bay in "re-education camps", within countries like Turkey, Tunisia, Mexico, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, and within countries on the borders of the European Union and Australia. The ultimate goal of Westernized countries with an aging demographic, is to harvest the children of refugees and migrants, to then indoctrinate and shape those children in the image of an Anglicized, blond-haired, blue-eyed, patriarchal god, for the purposes of being a slave to "meat lovers." 

"Innocent until proven guilty" only requires frivolous, fictitious, or facetious charges made by coordinated state-sponsored agents who operate those internment camps, to ascribe blame against targeted persons for deportation. The same method is also followed by public service units, as per their training, against refugees, immigrants, temporary residents, and visitors to Canada; only to then cause visceral harms and a wide range of injuries to persons targeted out of discrimination, within Canadian state-sponsored facilities, through illegitimate detention. 

Character assassination; intimidation; harassment; humiliation; cruelty; torment; torture; forced religious conversion or repression; deprivation of basic human rights and civil liberties; harms to personal properties and privacy; debilitation due to inflicted wounds and injuries; disruption or even devastation of family and social relationships; along with loss of livelihood, life, or livable habitat, thrust against wrongly accused and targeted persons, through systematic processes is a, sadistic and surreptitious way of committing serial murders, of selected community members. The fact that such serial harms and murders are systematically committed by coordinated agents and agencies using sophisticated tools, technologies, policies, methodologies, strategies, tactics, and secrets, while being supported by Canadian tax-payer monies, makes such violations and offenses: publicly funded genocidal activities of Canada. Hiding behind lousy maxims and idioms like, "innocent until proven guilty", only makes officers of Canadian defense and judiciary systems culpable, for being complicit in the furtherance of state-sponsored felonies, human rights violations, organized crimes, and genocides. 

A possible way to deter professional malpractices committed by public service units, especially to punish their wretched activities involving framing of innocent people for illegitimate detention and to deter harms done to vulnerable people via Eugenics, could be to: 

- Enforce a bond payable by the court systems of countries like Canada, to be held in an escrow account of an underwriter (such as, an internationally accredited financial institution in UAE, Qatar, or Singapore), as soon as any law enforcement agencies start to interact with a person or with the person's private data, for the purposes of any kind of investigations or monitoring activities. Similar to a bail bond payable by an accused as a contingency, if the procedures and processes administered by the court system turn out to be: 

    - sadistic,

    - malicious,

    - rigged with falsehoods, 

    - prejudicial, 

    - injurious, 

    - wrongful, 

    - or in any form that is contrary, unfair or in violation of the serviced entity's rights, 

    then, the liable court or public service group can be compelled to immediately remit compensations via the bonds held as a collateral in the escrow account, in the event of such violations, disservice, or a miscarriage of justice. 

- The value of the bond, along with punitive measures incorporated into it for deterring professional malpractices carried out by a municipality's or a country's public service groups, can be set by the international bond market for municipal and treasury bonds. 

- Such a guarantee for assuring and insuring the correctness of procedures used by court systems and public service agencies, against professional malpractices, can be contractually enforced by the insurance industry, without resorting to concepts like, "differed payments for compensations", and without forcing the wrongly prosecuted or serviced persons to "appeal to a 'higher court' for appropriate restitution." Cases involving professional malpractices and misconduct, of judiciary and other public services groups in countries like Canada, especially against members of vulnerable or international communities, can be adjudicated and redressed by a legislated committee that has staff from embassies of concerned countries, as independent observers and surveyors of the committee's actions. 

- The officers of the court, of countries like Canada, might as well be presumed trustworthy, faithful, and competent on a case-by-case basis, until proven to the contrary, in which event, the full cost of reprimanding the untrustworthy, unfaithful, or incompetent officers, is to borne by the state; along with the total cost of all necessary remedies for rectifying the wrongs of culpable public service units as well as of their contractors and proxy agents being payed immediately, by the judiciary and finance ministry of the state. 

### Show Me a Redeemer

So what happens when a municipality or a country refuses to pay its debts by evading or absconding repayment of reparations that it owes to victims and survivors of state-sponsored violations? What happens when those violators simply refuse to even acknowledge their wrongdoings, and continue to cause surreptitious harms to profiled and targeted people? 

Well, that is precisely what has been continuously happening among various municipal corporations, multi-national companies, and sovereign nation-states throughout the world. The heinous crimes of Canadian agents and agencies against persons like myself, isn't something new or surprising compared to historical, and ongoing, state-sponsored human rights abuses and politically motivated pernicious crimes involving abuse of medical sciences. 

Each time any corporate entity figures out a way to circumvent or corrupt the rules and regulations of a jurisdiction, rules that were agreed upon by way of contracts and covenants, or by way of treaties and conventions followed by trustworthy parties, which were meant to be dutifully enforced by a judiciary, the entity conveniently absolves itself of its debt obligations and penalties. This then causes the debt holders to become, a bit "miffed and annoyed", with the defaulting debtors and violators. 

For example, the hostility between non-Russian sovereign states (from Europe and North America), and Russia, is an age-old one in which Russia simply rescinded all of its obligations to pay the amounts it owed to its foreign debt holders. It did so at the end of World War II, by claiming that any and all amounts on ledgers of various international financial institutions were only to be honored by the Russian Czar, whose 'debauched' agreements with other sovereign rulers or governments had caused those debts to arise, and because the "New Soviet Russia" after World Wars I and II was not beholden to any type of an [absolute monarchy or a Czar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy#Russia), especially because all of those Russian rulers had been executed along with their titles and offices being dissolved, the new Russia with its 'modern' communist regime, simply had a 'clean slate.' So, no Czars, and no ledger of accounts, meant no debts. 

Of course, those financial ledgers did exist in the minds of American and British allies who had claimed to have won WWII, and to have become the 'new rulers' of the uni-polar world. However, because the communist regime of Russia after WWII, separately claimed that there could be no continuity between the previous and the incumbent authority figures of the Russian state, due to the supreme nature of their "communist ideology", there could be no form of historical agreements that could be honored by the new faces and rulers of the entire Soviet Union. 

The US and the UK, have since WWII, been entirely against the idea that a mere regime change and a re-branding of a nation, can absolve that nation of its historical debts. Britain and America, have thus been antagonistic to the idea of communism, suspecting that any other country that simply re-brands itself to being communist or socialist, will then rescind all of its international debts, similar to the USSR government. 

Consequently, the Russians have been against "hypocritical capitalists", stating that capitalist nations like the UK and the US, have continued to use unethical and predatory practices to subdue and subvert the independence of other countries, via "debt traps." International institutions such as the World Bank; the World Trade Organization; the International Monetary Fund; Bank of International Settlements; the chain of Central Banks across nations; multi-national chartered banks; and various other bodies affiliated with the United Nations, are supposedly designed for gaining undemocratic control of under-developed countries via economic and socio-political warfare. 

The usurpation of government powers by those financial institutions, by thwarting the rights of citizens of developing and under-developed countries, is often alleged to be through unethical monetary inducements used by those institutes, which are allegedly geared towards: cultural interference using underhanded economic and industrial policies, and political intrusions to even subdue military defenses of 'yet to be' Westernized countries. This is one of the main reasons for Russia's distrust of western controlled banking and financial systems, which were inevitably weaponized against Russia by NATO. Once NATO did that, it only highlighted the need for a multi-polar form of geo-political alignments to be established, via the adoption of multiple, global telecommunication systems with parallel networks that cannot be simultaneously scuttled, by any single bloc of corporations or countries.  

Now, who are the people that keep making seemingly 'baseless' allegations about Western controlled international financial institutes, as being nefarious and subversive, particularly against the Global South? 

Well, merely as an exercise, type the word "shadow" in an online search engine, along with the name of either of those international institutes (e.g. "shadow" + "Bank of International Settlements"). The searched links to online content are likely to sound 'unflattering' and 'conspiratorial', against those institutes. So it might be better to instead look at the official statement of purpose and activity, marketed by those institutes. 

As a mere example, here is a video about what the future of global monetary systems is likely to become, according to the official annual meeting of the board members, of the Bank of International Settlements - https://youtu.be/b-ZcFOthPnM 

Why do such things matter to ordinary human beings? All of it is of paramount significance and consequence, because it directly impacts the price and availability of oils, flour grains, fertilizers, textiles, vehicles, production tools, and all other things related to sustenance and sustainability, in each and every village, town, and city of the world. 

The above-mentioned video merely highlights that human beings are still struggling to define what "money" is, and arguing over what "trust" is supposed to be, especially in the context of real-time, global-scale, high-volume, high-frequency financial transactions and trades. So, how strong and authoritative are such international monetary institutions? They are only as cohesive and as dysfunctional as your actual, socio-biological family. The likelihood that delegates from different countries will manage to get any useful and worthwhile work done, when they meet, is the same as the likelihood of you getting along with your family members at your next public holiday dinner, involving any number of your nearest kith and kin. Why? It is simply because each generation of human beings throughout Earth and its history, has managed to successfully upset and piss-off the previous as well as the next generation of human beings out of ignorance and indifference, regardless of the geographic and cultural ties of those people, merely because of age based differences in worldviews of individualistic as well as group based desires. For instance, have you, as a human being, ever managed to not disrespect the needs and wishes off the previous and the next generation of members from your family, while trying to not get trampled and overruled by those people that you genuinely care for? How genuinely do you care for them, or can possibly do so, with a physical capacity to be able to survive in peace? 

However, I am going to guess that, at your dinner table, you don't come up with plots and schemes to commit grand larceny, and genocides. That is the job for 'Supreme Leaders' and their indoctrinated minions. Or, do you, because you are a racist fiend or an ideological bigot vying to become the next Supreme Leader of an international organization? Most probably not; and, if you are reading this, you are most probably a poor person, stuck in some middle-class society in some crowded part of the world, wondering how did you meander down this 'rabbit hole.'

At this point, you might as well ask yourself, is reading this article resulting in some type of a financial transaction between you and me, while making Microsoft corporation richer through that transaction over GitHub, without causing either of us to gain anything "earnest and valuable?" 

Also, is your attention, some type of a monetary token, or a currency of some sort? How about your private and personal data, and the meta-data associated with your privately or publicly viewable activities? 

What about your credence? Is your belief and credence in something, in itself, a currency? 

So, if, government leaders of erstwhile USSR, simply stopped believing that they owed anything to foreign countries following the events of WWII and the Russian Revolution of 1917, just the same way European and American supremacists have repeatedly rejected the idea of needing to pay their debts to survivors of colonial genocides and apartheid, what exactly has changed in the world? 

Technological advancements for facilitating international settlements in the context of trade and commerce, have certainly not changed the fact that a belligerent group of people with the capability to commit mass murders and thefts by brandishing weapons of mass destruction, cannot be persuaded to do morally and ethically legitimate deeds, nor can they be persuaded to be honorable, by any form of communications or actions taken by "humble people." This is especially true, when those dubious and belligerent groups can cunningly redefine the meaning of honorable deeds to be: the greater of the total count of murders and thefts committed against vulnerable people, as 'an achievement', in the name of "market disruption via 'entrepreneurship'." 

Somehow, those predatory and parasitic supremacists have never tried to 'disrupt' their stupidity and obliviousness. How could they? How, could they ever do so, with proper sincerity and seriousness? 

As such, what did I choose, or have chosen to do, about such heinous and problematic supremacists that already defiled my home in murderous ways?  

By the time I could find out who they were, and how they had orchestrated their genocidal activities, they had naturally gotten away with their misdeeds and wrongdoings. The more problematic issue is that they have continued to orchestrate murders and thefts using proxy agents along with the cheap excuse of, "plausible deniability." So, have they actually managed to get away, if I am still able to find out their names, addresses, and can track their activities? 

What now remains, is a way to thoroughly dismantle their dastardly means and mechanisms, and to have them brought to true, and lasting justice.
