# Caste and Religion Based Malpractices in South Asian Industries

The felony of keeping dead bodies, biological samples, or people, under confinement or captivity, particularly as collateral property for debt collection, has a potential for causing riots throughout India. 

Currently, various corporate bosses and doctors operating hospitals and clinics in India, are doing grossly lethal and destructive things against the integrity and sovereignty of The Republic, merely for increasing their profits through tax-evasion, and by cutting safety measures that have continued to thrust innocent patients into harms way. Those doctors and healthcare mangers are doing such destructive things against the well being of ***systematically targeted Central Government workers and retirees,*** due to unchecked greed, and due to willful malice orchestrated against salaried or pensioned, yet economically poorer sections of society.  

In this why, a country-wide elevated threat and a measurable danger for riots currently exits in India, because upper-cast Hindu corporate bosses and medical practitioners of various hospitals, in several Indian states, have been habitually and deliberately holding patients belonging to Muslim, Sikh, Christian, and other minorities or Dalit groups, as captive chattel and as leverage, for extorting money from family members of those patients, under the guise of debt collection for the hospital's "rendered medical goods and services."

This is a much more problematic issue than few doctors in various regions of India, who sadistically enjoy slashing or gashing patients within their operation rooms, or those who experiment on gullible victims using unethical medical techniques. 

>So, the malpractice insurance rate of all Indian medicos will need to increase by 6 folds, if any hospitals continue such felonies.[^1]

You can downplay this article about such malpractices, specifically occurring among India's accredited healthcare corporations, as an "exaggeration" or as a "lie" or as a piece of "fiction", at your own peril and risk, and at the cost of thousands of innocent lives in each city of India being potentially lost to eventual mob violence, if those bad hospitals and their Managing members aren't brought to justice. 

Cities from Amritsar to Kanya Kumari could burn, will burn, if the so-called Elites in India continue to abuse fellow human beings as chattel, or continue to push for slavery based practices, within any industry sector.
