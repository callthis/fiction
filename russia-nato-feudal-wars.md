## The Russia-NATO war as of 26th March, 2022. 

The environmental climatic changes, and wars in the Arctic region will devastate North America if NATO does not relent and yield to Russian demands in the eastern front of the EU. The rest of the world can simply do nothing in the ongoing war between Rusia and NATO currently being waged in Ukraine, just the way it did nothing of significance during the invasion of Georgia, Chechnya and Syria by Russia, or during the ongong genocide of Palastinians by Isreal. 

Public sentiment, as depicted by western media groups, is undividedly in favor of Ukraine. That form of public sentiment in "The West" has otherwise remained disunited and disjoined in the case of issues concerning all other wars in other regions of the world. 

And also, "those who mean business," have already hedged their bets against Russia, India, and China. 

In the case of Russia, the economic sanctions against it as a part of warfare is too obvious. However, in the case of India's relationships with western allies, things are much more subtle. 

The US, UK and EU controlled ratings companies downgraded the credit ratings of all Indian corporations saying that India's exposure to Russian imports for edible oils and natural gas was significantly high. Though Indian economists and traders disagree with the given rationale, the downgraded credit ratings have already negatively impacted foreign investments into Indian companies. Similarly, the outflow of money from Chinese projects and companies was immediate and is steadily increasing. That is, foreign investors are pulling out of China fearing that Russian sanctions will negatively impact Chinese exports to Russia and to other countries of Central Asia, given that Central Asian countries invariably provide industrial support to Russia. 

Those investors, primarily from western countries, are backing the crude oil and natural gas trade between the North American Atlantic coastline and the western seaports of Britain and the EU. Little do they understand that the Russian military anticipated this and has had their submarines waiting to cordone the Arctic and Atlantic sea routes. The Russian's were only pilot-testing their weapons and inexperienced recruits in Ukraine. The main offensive and target of experienced Russian troops and advanced weapons systems has always been against the age-old vilification of Russian culture and diaspora, by American and European mercantilism and by British imperialism. 

Also, given that the US and EU have taken a somewhat clear and hardline against the assimilation of Taiwan into China, there is a likelihood that China will go ahead and support Russia in a full scale military defensive as well as offensive strategy, covering all geographic locations that touch the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. Do you suppose China is going to let a multi-trillion dollar initiative slide just because NATO became antsy?

This means that if Russia supports the takeover of Taiwan by China, the Russians will be able to endear themselves to the Chinese Communist Party, in a way that the Americans, British and Europeans never can and never will. Plus, the Chinese aren't expecting any legitimate and genuine partnership from Eurocentric nations on *any topic of discussion.* Especially not from Lithuania! 

The Chinese Communist Party's sense of equality, prosperity, justice, and peace is rather different and in many ways, irreconcilable with that of Eurocentric views on such precepts. 

Isolating Russia and demonizing Russians, particularly Putin, isn't going to deescalate anything. It is only going to push Rusia, India, and China closer together. The only thing that China needs to do is to smooth the border issues with India, which will then boost their Belt and Road Initiative throughout Asia, Asian Pacific Islands, and Africa.  

The US, UK and EU have maintained the stance of repeatedly demoting their relationships with Asian, Asian Pacific Islander, and African countries. The western alliances have only seen the regions of Africa, Asia and Pacifica as a market to exploit, rather than an equal stakes partner in an openly shared path towards technological and socio-economic growth.  

The time to change that stance by western alliances was more than two decades ago. 

People in Asia and Africa already understand that if NATO encouraged Russia, or at least did not bother to even comment against Russia during the invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Mali, then NATO will not come to the genuine aid and support of Asian and African countries at any point in the future. The only remaining ally for improving infrastructure in African, Asian and Pacific Islander nations, is China, which needs oil and supplies from Russia. 

Furthermore, the Russians will never agree to lose or give up Ukraine, the people displaced from Ukraine will never be able to return to their hometowns because those towns and cities have the same smoldering shape as the ones in Afghanistan and Syria.

Russia will never allow any rebuilding or strengthening of Ukraine's military that could otherwise lead to "asymmetric warfare" pursued by Ukrainians against "Russian peoples and territories."

In all likelihood, once the the US, UK and EU thoroughly aggravate the Russians, the Russian military will simply bomb the snow out of Ancorage, Alaska and the wind out of Edminton, Alberta using hypersonic missiles. Merely these two cities getting bombed would cause all of North America to fall to it knees and become completely cripled. 

Even if Putin dies, gets assasinated, or somehow gives up, the rest of Russian military is not going to back down anymore, because they have been made to appear as the villains even though they were only following the same playbook during this decade as the British, Germans, and the Americans did in the previous centuriesï¹˜in laying siege for imperial conquests.

Imperialists don't care for public opinion about who is the good guy or the bad guy, they only care about land grab and about who is the dead guy versus the alive guy. 

International investors and investment groups eventually fall in line with one or the other imperial regime of the alive guys. 

And this is how all of us will continue to remain stuck in the rut of a medieval worldview, stoked by imperialism and mercantilism!
