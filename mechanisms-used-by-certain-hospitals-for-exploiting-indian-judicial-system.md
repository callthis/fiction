## Few of The Mechanisms Used by Certain Corporate Bad-Actors for Exploiting The Indian Judicial System

>This article highlights topics pertaining to the Indian healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, in general. It also elucidates particular issues and problems with the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), being operated by the public enterprise known as the Directorate of CGHS, which belongs to Government of India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 

Various corporate Hospitals in India have been misusing CGHS for *[price discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discovery)* in the open market, so that they can excavate the base price of goods and services in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, only to then abuse that knowledge. It has come to light that, a number of corporate hospitals in India have managed to become accredited as "CGHS Empanelled Hospitals", merely to gain insider information about the "fair price" of medical goods and services, before those base rates and tariffs are published by Government of India's Directorate of CGHS to the public. 

In the course of their corporate dealings and affairs, those nefarious hospitals have repeatedly marked up that excavated base price by a factor of multiple folds, ahead of their competitors in the market that aren't CGHS Empanelled Hospitals. This is how those crooked hospitals have been able to sell their hiked products and services to lured Consumers using dishonest marketing by misuing and abusing the "label and brand image of CGHS." 

The maximum amount of profit those types of bad-actors in the market can gain, is via deliberate breach of trust and breach of contract against Consumers entitled to benefits of CGHS, for rendering medical goods and services at a price much greater than the yearly prescribed CGHS rates. That is precisely what those bad-actors in the healthcare industry have chosen to do, because they can keep getting away with that type of fraud and scam hidden within their unfair trade practices, by taking undue advantage of the limitations in the design of India's "Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission."

The "Consumer Forums" in India for redressal of legal disputes are not full fledged courts of the law, but rather, they are quasi-judicial bodies that can only evaluate the fairness or unfairness of a seller's trade practices. Especially, the district level Consumer Forums are limited by the existing wordings within ***the Consumer Protection Act of 2019,*** to not take legal action against, and to not even take cognizance of punishable violations and offences that are in the form of unjust activities or statutory crimes committed via any trade practices of a vendor or a seller. By exploiting this loophole in the Indian judicial system, corporate lawyers have managed to convince all other lawyers and even the police, to have them advice victims to first go to a local "Consumer Forum", if there is any involvement of a corporation's services in an untoward incident. That is how, poor victims are sent onto a wrong path and misled away from justice, who then get stuck in having to jostle with an applet court that isn't a regularised court to begin with. 

It needs to be understood by Consumers that all activities of theft and coercion are punishable by the law in the Indian Judicial System, if it can initially be recognized by the *[district or metropolitan judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_India#Courts_Structure).* Disguising felonies and other punishable offences within legal cases involving "unfair trade practices" that are sent to a Consumer Court instead of a Magisterial Court, allows corporate wrongdoers to get away with a tiny penalty or a monetary fine if they are ever caught. Those syndicated crime bosses any ways happen to think of such tiny penalties as "a mere cost of doing business." So, by never getting caught for their more serious and insidious crimes hidden within unfair trade practices, and by almost always causing the legal suite in a Consumer Forum to get sabotaged or scuttled through known tactics of abusing the system, corporate wrongdoers are able to get away with their punishable offences. Worse, by using such mechanisms of syndicating crimes, corporate wrongdoers are also able to normalize their bad behaviors as "the standard trade practice and prevalent culture" within their industry. 

If the Consumer is more persistent in receiving due justice, the accused corporations attempt to force an out-of-court settlement so that the crimes never become known to the market through public records.  

Now, universities, hospitals, and temples naturally have a higher esteem within Indian society compared to startup businesses, and therefore, those highly esteemed institutions are easily used by bad-actors to disguise their nefarious activities. For example, the simplest con-artistry that members of bad hospitals have been engaging in these days, to exploit the judicial system, is to have doctors do rounds in their hospital's wards by spending less than 5 to 10 mins with each patient, and to then charge the patient a bill for half an hour or an hour of medical consultation services. That hiked and surcharged bill is typically Rs. 700 to Rs. 1000 for an half-hour consultation with a general physician, though it is supposed to be Rs. 175 according to the current CGHS rates. So, culpable physicians, have managed to bill for 15 to 20 half-hour sessions within two hours of doing their rounds in such bad hospitals. The hard evidence and proof of their culpability, is in the financial records of the hospitals and in the time-stamped bills given to patients. 

Of course, if those bills were proper invoices, Consumers would have been able to dispute the surcharged bills as per the terms and conditions printed in a regular invoice. However, because those irregular and fraudulent bills are ordinary "Cash Memos" without any terms and conditions for settling payments for postpaid medical goods and services, Consumers are forced to pay those unfairly accounted bills, under the duress of coercive tactics used by the culpable managing members of those bad hospitals. 

Those coercive tactics include holding a targeted patient under wrongful confinement within the hospital building, as a piece of collateral property, to then bully the patient's next-of-kin (or legal guardian) to pay the for the patient's ransom in the disguise of "medical fees for goods and services rendered in good-faith." But those goods and services were never rendered in earnest good-faith. The placid threat and blackmail of not discharging the patient until the inflated "final bill" is settled by the paying Consumer, allows those corporate wrongdoers to pretend as if they did not commit any wrong, or at least, that they did not commit a violent act of theft and coercion. 

The managing members of such bad hospitals also cunningly choose to commit blackmail for amounts less than Rs. 5,00,000 against each targeted victim. In this way, if such a hospital's mangers and staff get investigated and then legally blamed for foul-play by a court of the law, then those offenders can simply feign repentance for their "tiny infraction" to then receive forgiveness or a mere monetary penalty from the adjudicating court. There are of course dozens of such targeted victims harmed each week, by injurious healthcare providers. So, the monthly amount of unearned incomes gained by such bad hospitals is in the Crores of Indian Rupees. 

The fact of the matter is that, the very moment the members of those bad hospitals including the managerial and medical staff, chose to engage in such a betrayal through clandestine bad behaviors, they criminally breached the trust reposed in them by unassuming Consumers from the public. 

The much worse abuse of the public's trust, through market manipulation and price-fixing activities among a nexus of CGHS Empanelled Hospitals and various state-sponsored entities, is a deplorable tragedy, and a grave insult to The Law. 

Now, there is no possible way for those bad hospitals to erase or counterfeit years of financial records generated from their corporation's fraudulent billing practices that were forced upon thousands of Consumers each month. So, how has that nexus of hospitals and state-sponsored employers been screened and protected from being properly identified and prosecuted? Have those wrongdoers been receiving protection from political leaders or corrupt officials? 

Indeed, the indelible and indisputable evidence of the wrongful and unlawful activities being committed daily in broad daylight, is available in the hands of the hospital's executive managers, and also in the hands of the conned and victimized Consumers, in the form of bills and receipts. However, the culpable members of each of those bad corporate hospitals have continued to use defective financial accounting systems for committing organized crimes, by somehow circumventing annual audits and inspections from the Indian Government's Excise and Tax Collections Agencies. 

The worst part is, if those bad-actors and mafia bosses who are plainly operating with impunity in the healthcare industry, were to ever get caught, the money they have stashed away in foreign off-shore accounts and tax-heavens, typically won't be recoverable by the responsible government agencies, to compensate the victims and survivors of such organized crimes.  

Sometimes, just sometimes, the government agencies do manage to catch the criminals as well as recover the stolen monies, in order to promote the interests of public good, justice, and equity. This is when, as soon as those mafia bosses disguised as corporate managers and doctors are caught, their personal and business bank accounts need to be frozen and seized, and the wages of their employees who have been enjoying unearned incomes, need to be docked.
