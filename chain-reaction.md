# Chain Reaction
A story about unmitigated cataclysm dedicated to moronic Canadian and American naval admirals who think that submarines and the navy will outlast submariners. These admirals never seem to be able to acknowledge that both submarines and submariners cannot exist without water.

To swim with sharks, you have to be a shark or a shark eater, be water my friend. 


## Hypersonic Shockwave
A particular retired military analyst (retired due to disabilities) who chanced upon satellite imagery of the Arctic region, while writing freelance reports about crude oil excavations, noticed a few peculiar and startling images. Images of naked people sitting in lawn chairs and skinny-dipping in a large rectangular ice hole at the Canadian arctic coast. And a submarine next to their dipping hole! These were Russian naval cadets fooling around and basically taking a holiday on the Canadian Arctic coast.    

The Bravo and Charlie battalions of the Russian navy were practicing live missions to calibrate their Northern Fleet's fire solutions in November 2019. One of the submarine commanders was cocky enough to take his crew on a holiday onto the surface, off the coast of Banks Island near Aulavik National Park. 

Protecting natural resources and the environment is never the priority of the armed forces of any country but Russian and American Atlantic fleets are particularly careless about the tonnes of damage they inflict upon oceanic and coastal ecologies. As they happen to be the number one customers of crude oil products and because all of their destroyers and carriers are designed to use the worst sludge from oil refineries it is very easy to detect the trail of pollution they leave in their wake. They also conveniently dump cuboid bundles of compacted plastic wrappers and other trash in the ocean associated with the packaging material of their food, clothing and other onboard rations. The infrared signature of these trash bundles is very easy to detect with remote sensing satellites like Landsat because of the peculiar military grade Mylar sheething used in packaging their rations. 

So why were the Americans and Canadians unaware of these cocky Russians? Well, they as usual, outsourced the most important aspect of engineering and information management to the lowest bidder. In this case the outsourced contractors were Norwegians. The tiny but efficient Norwegian military has the gargantuan chore of monitoring the entire Arctic and North Atlantic region to see if the Russians are unnecessarily flexing their military muscles. The Russians never think that there is such a thing as unnecessary flexing or unnecessary expansion of their front-yard. The poor Norwegians were willing to work for crumbs while the British fleets slacked off and half of the American Atlantic fleet was sent off to screw around in western Pacific to keep tabs on ChYnA! (Imagine China pronounced in a Trump-like voice as ChYnA) 

Well actually the British weren't slacking off they were busy trying to get a handle on Russian naval gifts to Turkey that have started to dominate the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Suez; consequently blocking British access to Cyprus and Djibouti. And due to Brexit, the EU has no business in helping out the Brits; EU is absolutely not interested in the somewhat French-German wannabe Brits from India called Canadians. 

What about Australians? This is such a digression to Australia but yes, if the Australians were supposedly cooperating in the Pacific then the Americans would not have needed to send half of the Atlantic fleet to South-East Asia and Western Pacific. But the Australians were busy trying to make [smores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S'more#Preparation) using forest fires. 

Coming back to the Bravo and Charlie Russian units fooling around in Arctic: without the proper human resources and data analysis skills needed to monitor the (w)hole of the Arctic, the poor Canadians were stuck cajoling themselves with stories about how America and Britain would continue to be their lord and saviour. But in late November 2019 some astute Canadian secret service agent caught wind of extremely loud gossip in Kitchener City Farmer's Market about Canadian's need to have "all hands on deck!".

You see, trickle-down free market economics applies to trading discussions on the state of the intelligence networks along with the state of **the onion**. 

However, no matter how hard any analyst (active or disabled) tries to clear out the fog of war, so that the front line can move forward, there are too many politicians who get in the way of basic sensibility. It is easier for politicians to sell stories of how wonderful the economy is doing, how there is nothing to be concerned about, and how every-possible-thing is just great or can be made great again!

The lifeline of North American greatness in economics, politics, and martial tactics, is crude oil. The Russians figured that:

<ol list-style-type: lower-roman>
  <li> Use a submarine launched BrahMos like missile at Alberta oil sands production facilities so that the entire pipeline to Texas catches fire. It would take decades to put out a resulting river of fire as long as the Mississippi River running through the Dakotas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas. During those decades the ensuing fires among forests, farms and cities would create enough smoke and ash to bury all of North America and then some. 
  <li> Hack into the logistics companies shipping freight via trains, to get the manifest of diesel, petrol, potash (fertilizer), high-fructose corn syrup, and scrap metal. Then use an aerial launched BrahMos like missile at a train yard in Ontario, Alberta or British Columbia where freight trains carrying such material happened to be stationed together or passing each other. Since potassium nitrate is an oxidizer second only to liquid oxygen, tonnes of KNO3 exploding with tonnes of petroleum or diesel or corn syrup would create an explosion that would be large enough to explode automobile gas stations within a 2 mile radius. These would in turn generate a wave of explosions every mile among neighboring gas stations, super stores carrying propane, automobile gas tanks, etc. If tonnes of rusted scrap metal (iron and aluminum) stored on freight trains or in neighbouring scrap yards is added to this mix, the resultant explosion would also achieve sputtering [thermite.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite#Ignition) All this while turning pieces of train, road vehicles, buildings etc. into shape charges. Within nano or micro seconds, the city-wide shockwave from the explosion(s), the thermite level heat (3k++ deg C) and the supersonic molten metal projectiles would shatter even concrete buildings and roads into tiny pieces! They would most certainly sublimate human bones! 
  <li> Mechanically hack water supply mains to pump kerosene into fire hydrants and building sprinkler systems. If a small fire were to start in such a building connected to a hacked network of water supply, the automatic sprinklers would pour pressurized kerosene onto the fire. The resulting explosive blaze would trigger the neighbouring building's sprinklers and so on in a chain reaction of fires engulfing the city within seconds rather than hours or days. 
</ol>

If anybody thought that petards (suicide bombers), planes crashing into buildings, anthrax envelopes, etc. were really terrifying, then there is simply no expression to explain the horrors of the above three scenarios. 

These kinds of attacks can surely be prevented, can't they? Don't the North Americans have missile defense systems and valiant personnel to avert such scenarios? 

No, we simply don't have squat diddly out here to deal with this kind of a threat. The Chinese have their jamming satellites (at 33000 km altitude) to mess with the American and British satellites (at 20000 km altitude used for antimissile defense systems.) Moreover, it is too difficult to detect and track missiles launched from the Arctic. The advantage those BrahMos and similar missiles have is that they don't have to suffer greater Coriolis effect at the Arctic during launch phase. And once they achieve cruise speed, a defense mechanism to avert them is left to chance. If even a single one of such cruise missiles come through, the above scenario of scorched-earth, rather, a scenario of no-earth would ensue.

To avoid such cataclysm, the Japanese were working on a way to target such supersonic and hypersonic missiles before or during launch, using a neutron beam, but in November-2019 they had run out of ultra-pure water to conduct their experiments :(

Additionally, after becoming subservient to the US, Canada botched the 5G related issues. At this point of time in fall 2020, the Chinese won't bother to help Canada using their satellites even if Justin Trudeau got dressed in a bikini as a cabaret dancer and grovelled in front of Xi Jing Pin. The US-led Canadian treachery against China was to sneakily buy 5G equipment from Nokia-Eriksson in 2014 - 2016, and screw over Huawei in Q1 of 2018, all the while pretending up till Q4 of 2017 that established contracts with Huawei would be honored. By December 2019, the heavy steel castings for hoisting the 5G equipment were already erected all across Canada; those castings were ordered in 2017, prior to the excuse published in Q1 of 2018 that Huawei equipment was a national security threat to US, Canada, UK and EU. That excuse was used as a justification to rescind contracts with Huawei costing China trillions of dollars in direct losses and millions of job cuts in the long run. The subsequent arrest and slander of the Huawei CFO - Meng Wanzhou, as part of the American "Trade War" against ChYnA, along with the sycophantic appeal to US extradition laws, left a permanent gash in Canadian-Chinese diplomatic ties.  

So, who else remains in this story? Ah yes, Team Snowden.

Why Snowden?! 

Why not Snowden!? 

Given that the hive-eyes have spent years chasing him while running a multi-billion dollar tax-payer footed bill, to not at all achieve anything worthy, would you rather be on Team Hive-eyes, or on Team Snowden? 

Snowden built an aggregator using simple **mv** commands to spool data from any conceivable data stream when he was at NSA. Even though Edger J's mom would have been very proud of such an accomplishment, the NSA, CIA, and FBI mangled his work in an effort to "improve it." They wanted to spool data from *every* conceivable data stream including Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. The original aggregator had its shortcoming but those weren't at the technical level, they were at the human factors and cognition level of people trying to make a judgment call from the multitude of reports being generated by Snowden's AI engine. By winter 2014 - spring 2015, Snowden had improved that AI which he still had access to, with the help of his "liberal left-centered friends" in the NSA. And he did all that while sitting around in a motel in rural Canada. He just might be able to help Canada because he is practically Canadian now. 

Am I one of those friends of his? No. I am still a neutral party who is not interested in going to Switzerland. I would rather bring Switzerland to Canada and finally have proper ISO weight measures become part of common Canadian parlance than go to the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia or any other part of the EU.[^1] 

But if there is no Canada left due to scorched-earth... no-earth scenario? Then what? Why not move to India or Australia to get away from becoming collateral damage? 

Canada, India and Australia are respectively, the armpits, crotch and butt crack of the British Commonwealth! All these places need a proper wipe and a shave! 

So I am simply doing what I can, how I can, when I can, forever freely, with free as in free.

[^1]: Well, that was my situation in December 2020, and up till July 2021. I then had to move on from being neutral with Canada, similar to the way I was forced me to move on from being friendly to neutral, after state-sponsored Canadian operatives had caused the death of my infant child and the destruction of my home, in May 2020, out of their prejudices and xenophobia. I'm still not friends with Snowden though, never was and never needed to be. He does his own thing, and I do mine. Steve Wozniac is more likely to know how to get in touch with Snowden, compared to anyone else, that is, if Snowden is still alive. But Wozniac is busy being "happy and content", to ever get involved in the world's ongoing geopolitical affairs.
