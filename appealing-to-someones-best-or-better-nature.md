## How to appeal to someone's best or better nature

[@GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/section/locations/london) You seem to be a glutton for data. So here is some more data for you...

It turns out that, globally at any given hour, more than 70% of commercial airplanes on the tarmac or in the air, have something to do with insurance companies bought into by The Crown, often via Ireland or the UAE. 

And...

The managerial corporations under the control of The Crown have also been pressuring healthcare companies in India for delivering an exponentially compounding Return on Investment (ROI) by having those healthcare organizations cut corners. 

Airlines, airplane manufacturers, aircraft maintenance companies, airports, and hospitals have been privatized among various Commonwealth Countries in a particular way, so that they can market themselves as *premier* establishments with the highest quality of standards for serving the public, to attract an increasing number of local and international customers. This is being done, only to then sneakily cut corners and degrade safety standards among those privatized entities by jeopardizing the well being of passengers and patients. Most often, such dirty and clandestine deeds are being committed by managers and various share holders of those privatized entities, so that they can satisfy their as well as The Crown's greed. This is truly awful and deplorable! 

>The Crown's greed has always been insatiable to begin with, so it isn't surprising that "Third World Countries" are still getting pillaged and plundered by The Crown's at-arms-length corporate underlings.  

Take for example, the way The Crown prods the pension funds in Canada to invest in the "Common Wealth" of Indian private hospitals, to then have those investors gouge vulnerable people within Indian towns and cities who are in need of routine or urgent healthcare treatments. Consequently, managers of those corporate hospitals in India have been cutting safety standards by scheduling patients every 10 minutes in each 9 hour workday, 6 days a week, to then have the overworked and overloaded physicians spend less than 5 minutes with each patient, all the while making the patients wait for more than an hour at the hospital for a pre-scheduled appointment, by also accepting walk-ins. This naturally risks the safety and well being of vulnerable people in Asia, specifically because those overburdened physicians and nurses have been committing mistakes and violations that have already led to serious problems. 

Having overworked medical practitioners in India, or burdening aircraft maintenance companies in Singapore and Malaysia, all of which lead to harms to the public in South Asian countries, is simply tragic. More importantly, these are also an emergent factor for escalated conflicts. But not only that, having international insurance companies pay corporate lawyers to cause attrition to suffering victims and survivors as plaintiffs of wrongful deaths or injuries, particularly those who have endured multiple and recurring bad incidents within critical industry sectors of countries like India, is plainly greed-driven insidiousness. 

So, I can let you know that I received the message from the Americans about having Mr. Vijay Mallya picked up, and I passed it along. However, it seems that there isn't a single person interested in taking him back. Turns out that he has outlived his usefulness for the Indian public, especially because you have sucked him dry. Plus, he and his forefathers were Briton's Lapdogs since the 18th Century, so, there isn't anybody here who has any use for Briton's [Stool Knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom_of_the_Stool). 

>In all likelihood, Mr. Mallya has already divulged all the State Secrets and Industrial Secrets he was privy to, in his bid to get Knighted by The Crown as a "Peer of The Realm." 

I understand that Mr. Vijay Mallya has been bargaining with members of The Crown because he thinks that he ought to be elevated as Sir Vijay Mallya to the House of Lords (UK), especially because he likens himself to being the "Indian Richard Branson." Of course, Mr. Vijay Mallya is not at all within the league of Sir Richard Branson and is in fact, a "चूसा हुआ आम का गुठली" (i.e. a sucked mango seed). 

So unless someone puts him six-feet-under into the ground, he isn't going to germinate into anything useful for anyone. And as you know, Mr. Vijay Mallya is such a piece of trash that you might as well do it yourself, mostly because he isn't worth the trouble for anybody here. 

Mr. Vijay Mallya is indeed an absconding felon, but it turns out that he is still a trend setter, and as I write this, a group of healthcare managers and practitioners from India are preparing to flee to Britain, like him, in order to escape prosecution for their major crimes. 

Now, I can't let those members of the international healthcare mafia abscond so easily. But "who" exactly am I, to have any say in such matters?

Well, I'm no one. 

I'm not zero, or joker, or scarecrow, or Tiger, or Bobby, or anybody else. I'm simply no one. But please don't call me Nobody, otherwise nobody could get offended. 

More importantly, I'm not the one burning down NATO's forests in Canada and in the USofA. There are more than two dozen sappers and saboteurs running around in North America, each from a variety of different countries who are doing that. I certainly don't have anything to do with any of them! How could I? 

And though the US National Guard and Marines have been roving around in America's metropolitan cities, looking for "illegal aliens", they still aren't looking in the right places for those pyro-maniacs (or pyro-genies or pyro-mavericks, whatever you may like to call them).

>Eventually I might be able to make my peace with the way Canadian operatives killed my child, and with the way they desecrated my home and family life while I was living there as an ordinary resident. 
>
>In the mean time, I have already made my peace with Canada's forests simply burning down, a few thousand hectares at a time. 
>
>Oh! But wait till you see the radioactive wildfires in Canada that will mirror the Aurora Borealis in the dead of winter. That will be a sight to behold, within images taken from space satellites.  

But, you most probably already knew all of that, right?

So, I guess, I have nothing new to offer you. 

Take care then,

Cheers!
