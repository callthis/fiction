## More on Personality

The personality type known as a [moron,](https://i.ibb.co/LpsCcgC/moron-with-a-halo.png) is often neglected within psychology research. 

To truly appreciate human nature, in its fullest complexity and extent, we ought to address that gap in research about morons. So, we shall first look at some of the pop-culture versions of science about personality traits, that are still being taught to students of Psychology in schools, colleges, and universities. And then, we will have a look at the "Bible of Psychiatry", that has been prescribed to medical professionals in Westernized cultures since the nineteen-fifties.

Are any of the following categories or labels, personality traits? 

- courageous vs cowardly

- uneducated vs educated 

- sleepy vs awake

- grumpy vs cheerful 

- self-assertive vs sheepish

- preference for spicy vs bland food 

- cat owner vs dog owner

- racist and bigoted vs not, racist and bigoted

- leadership: commanding vs sycophantic 

- sexual orientation: heterosexual or not  

- religiosity: religious vs irreligious vs quasi-religious

<br>

More specifically, of the above types of qualities that a person may exhibit at times to an observer, which qualities might be due to a combination of traits described in the ["Big 5 Model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Measurements) of personality traits? 

The Big 5 Personality traits are: 

1. conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)  

1. agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)  

1. neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)  

1. openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  

1. extroversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  


Let me rearticulate the main question of this section, in a different way, so that it is more clear, "Which combination of factors from the Big 5 Model of personality traits would constitute an observable characteristic of a person, such as 'educated vs uneducated'?"

In personality research, psychoanalysts who are enthusiastic about typecasting people into a bin using a model from pop-science, often use a points based system for each category of traits described within their chosen model. For example, an individual's persona might be typecast into: "40% conscientious, 64% agreeable, 18% neurotic, 59% open to novel experiences, and 83% extrovert." Among such ratings, the combinations and permutations of points for each category label of a trait, often amount to nothing useful or meaningful, because they are derived from questionnaires given to an individual, which the individual can answer differently each time they receive the questionnaire along with the previous test's computed results. The idea that the given questionnaire somehow acts as an instrument or a gauge, for delivering "objective measurements" of an individual's personality, is a fallacy.   

Worst of all, most psychologists and psycho-analysts who administer such questionnaires with the belief that it will reveal some form of a hidden truth, about an individual's attitudes, "latent dispositions", or decision making capacity, have themselves never bothered to research the topic of personality assessment, to any significant depth of understanding. One may say that, the professional sociologist or psychologist administering a personality test, is often unaware or completely oblivious to the fact that, their own personality shapes the way they provide and then interpret results of personality tests. For that matter, every individual's momentary circumstances, intentions, motivations, morals, ethos, experiences, and individuality, is a factor in how that individual interprets observations or interactions, pertaining to any other being.[^1] 

So, if you would like to know which type of a psychologist or an analyst is better qualified to make a worthwhile assessment about someone's personality traits, you merely need to ask the following questions to the professional providing the assessment: 

1. What constitutes or defines the personhood of a being? 

2. How would one distinguish between personality traits and character traits of an individual, after establishing the validity of that individual's personhood? 

A professional who can answer the above types of questions, has at least bothered to ponder about such topics at a more reasonable depth of research and understanding. The rest, should not be qualified as professionals. 

[^1]: By the way, those who aren't even anthropocentric, simply cannot be egocentric or narcissistic. But they can most certainly be morons for going up against the powers that be, and then simply perishing in their fight against injustice.

<details><summary><h3>Bible of Psychiatry</h3></summary>

The Christian Bible is centered around a main character known as Jesus, who is portrayed as the savior of humanity in that narrative, via the accounts retold by the Apostles and early leaders of the Christian Church. 

A range of characteristics of "The Messiah" or "The Christ", were popularly known to Judaic peoples throughout the Mediterranean region, based on their oral tradition of prophesies, folklore, legends, and mythologies. By the beginning of the year 200 CE, those characteristics and traits were attached and attributed to the individual known as Jesus (of Nazareth), by the followers of the nascent Christian Church of that time, within and around the Roman Empire. 

Centuries prior to all of that, around 200 BCE, heroes were typically characterized as valiant warriors within the narratives from Nordic, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Persian, Indian, Chinese, Mayan, and other existent cultures, during the era when paper as a medium for record keeping was being invented. The idea that heroes could sacrifice their lives instead of pillaging and plundering for fame and riches, was novel, during the year 100 CE. 

Today however, more than two thousand years from when a particular bachelor who was not a warrior, and who got impaled on planks of wood for saying that he was the son of God while walking around like a hippie, the idea of heroism and self-sacrifice, is labeled as a pathological disorder. 

Hero-complex or savior-complex is a type of psychopathology wherein, a person suffering form that mental disease, looks pitifully upon other individuals in seemingly less fortunate or poorer circumstances, compared to the patient's own conception of those poor people's state and outlook, ought to be. Consequently, the patient utilizes every measure of obsessive, delusional, and forceful action to "save or rescue" the target individuals from their so-called affliction or peril, as perceived by the mentally ill patient. 

A characteristic feature of a patient suffering from savior-complex is their denials of having any type of tendencies for being or wanting to become a hero, or a savior, while taking extraordinary steps to rescue people they think need saving. Such mental patients are otherwise, high-functioning individuals who can mask their hero-complex with clever justifications about the nature of their profession, as opposed to their psychopathology that compels them to do markedly distinct things to save people. Often, covetousness or greed for valor, fame, glory, bounty, and social-validation drive the motives and actions of patients suffering from savior-complex. A much more typical form of savior-complex is white-savior-complex in which, a patient feels that it is their God-given duty, to rescue non-white and non-Christian persons from their state of existing in "sin."  

Can medical professionals, early responders, analysts, priests, judiciary officers, penitentiary workers, teachers, bureaucrats, authority figures, and even parents or family members or friends, have a psychopathology like hero-complex? Yes, they can. And because of which, they simply do not notice the harm they do to others in their bid to being or becoming a savior. Also, can the pathological behavior of acting as a holy-savior be amplified via the social interactions among groups of patients afflicted by hero-complex? Yes it can be, especially in cults. 

Coincidentally, the disease-model of hero-complex as a psychopathology, a personality disorder, a character flaw, a spiritual affliction, or as a medical concern, is only as sound and scientifically true, as all other categories of ailments described in the Bible of Psychiatry called, the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#Criticisms). Those descriptions might seem legitimate and reasonable, except that they are not at all objective. The DSM is not a proper source of information for legitimate medical science, it is a catalog for peddling pharmaceuticals using vague and made up categories of cognitive and behavioral disorders. Topics covered within the DSM, simply do not provide any references and discussions about any scientific factors, measurements, or facts pertaining to anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, pharmaco-genetics, or of gene expression in human beings. Popularizing the DSM as the golden rule-book for psychiatry via hospitals, clinics, colleges, and schools, and as *the* valid scientific source of medical knowledge in mental healthcare, has been an industrially orchestrated marketing trick. Such an industrially promulgated ploy, has allowed cultural policing of the public via punitive actions administered unethically using biochemicals and clinical procedures. 

But at least, those types of violations and visceral harms inflicted upon a person via electromechanical, surgical, and biochemical methods, using the guise of medical treatment, aren't as bad as being impaled on planks of wood in a public square. 

>So, how does one obtain legitimate mental healthcare treatment in current day and age? It can only be obtained by acknowledging that anything pertaining to human health, has to firstly do with anatomy and physiology in the medical sense of scientifically measurable, biological markers. Subsequently, one needs to acknowledge that socio-economic, political, legal, and personal finance based functions of a human being, are not to be evaluated via any type of a disease-model, in assessing a person's medical fitness. 
>
>All non-medical factors impacting human health, can only be correctly considered from a "capacities", and "depletion" based model of human activities. If aspects of a person's physical, social, economic, educational, political, or legal resources are depleted due to ecological factors, then drugging that person or subduing them using medical or counseling techniques, or policing techniques, aren't going to repair and replenish those depleted reserves. 

It is true that medical treatment providers in impoverished societies (particularly in Westernized ones), tend to prioritize the use of high dosage drugs for "sedation", or "pacification", of persons who may be distressed or agitated, especially if the form of agitation is provably 'dangerously threatening', to themselves or to others. Those healthcare providers tend to do so, because of their indoctrinated view that something else, or someone else, will eventually repair the ecological issues and non-biological problems impacting the person needing aid, after a measure of 'peace and tranquility' is firstly obtained via 'minimally' intrusive and invasive methods, deployed by on-duty public service units. This type of reasoning is also utilized by invading military and paramilitary units, who believe that overwhelming use of violent force, that destroys or quells existing civic institutions in the region being invaded, causes a *chilling effect* upon survivors in that region, which is a sufficient substitute for 'peace', compared to completely annihilating the invaded region.  

That is why, innocent people who do not have the authority and power to influence the cultural policies and regulations within their ecology, only suffer harm and a chilling effect, when those innocent people are forcibly subdued via hurtful, malicious, and damaging set of actions taken by coordinated judiciary officials, medical professionals, social service providers, and early-responders. Such harms propagated by a cascade of force utilized by coordinated state-sponsored agencies can be devastating to victims, particularly when those harms are committed by citing institutionalized rules and regulations that are forced upon targeted individuals and communities, by officials obligated with a "duty of care". Furthermore, brandishing medicine and medical diagnostic labels as a threat against peaceful protesters and dissidents, is fiendishly sadistic and insidiously cruel. But at least, all of that is not as bad as being crucified for heresy or being burnt alive for witchcraft, is it?
