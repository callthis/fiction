Who can afford to have enemies?

Do you suppose there will ever come a day, when America will have no enemies? Most probably if you speak to a randomly chosen Republican Senator about that day, they will say something like, "Yes, the day when America conquers and rules the world, as its absolute and sole supreme power, by crushing and defeating all of its enemies, that day, America shall have no enemies." 

America already has no friends and only has hostages with Stockholm Syndrome, in international geopolitics. So, by now you might have realized that, those warmongering Senators have always been aiming towards fueling a cataclysmic, never-ending world war, in pursuit of their fantasy to rule the world as its absolute, supreme leaders. 

You may also ask yourself, "Is it even remotely sane or possibly realistic, for America or Britain, or any other nation or a conglomerate for that matter, to ever aim towards global supreme dominance and primacy, over all of human kind for all of eternity?"

This is why, one might as well be cognizant that,

>Do unto others, as you'd wish to be done to, your children and grandchildren. When you get to see the horror and agony in their eyes due to your deeds, you will finally accept and acknowledge what you should, and shouldn't have done, by your willful and forceful choices. 

But, if your children and grandchildren were killed before they could be born, due to systematic reproductive and sexual harms done to you, by those who intended to destroy your kind, merely because of the color of your skin, or your place of origin, or because of your religious beliefs, then you won't have to see anything in the eyes of your children or grandchildren. More importantly, they will never have to see anything in your eyes.
