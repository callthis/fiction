One becomes what one consumes. 

So let us see if imperialists and colonialists have become more humanitarian and humane, by their acts of consuming humans, via their war machines? No, they haven't. 

Have they become more innocent and egalitarian, by devouring innocent children and underpaid laborers through their sweatshops? No, they haven't. 

The ghoulishly cannibalistic and predatory methods used by supremacists in defiling the Earth, hasn't made them humanitarian nor egalitarian; all though, they have become ever more sophisticated and clever, in hiding their ways of turning prisoners of war, and the displaced diaspora of invaded nations, into commoditized, tokenized, and bite-sized consumable refugees.
