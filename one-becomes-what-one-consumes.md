One becomes what one consumes. 

So let us see if imperialists and colonialists have become more humanitarian and humane, by their acts of consuming humans, via their war machines? No, they haven't. 

Have they become more innocent and egalitarian, by devouring innocent children and underpaid laborers, through their sweatshops and petrochemical industries? No, they haven't. 

The ghoulishly cannibalistic and predatory methods used by supremacists in defiling the Earth, hasn't made them humanitarian nor egalitarian; all though, they have become ever more sophisticated and cleverer, in hiding their ways of turning prisoners of war, and the displaced diaspora of invaded nations, into commoditized, tokenized, and bite-sized consumable refugees. 

It can be plainly observed that, as living beings, we get shaped and propelled to become, only into what we can become, by the constraints laid upon the health and equity of our ecological existence. 

A polluted ecology driven into oblivion, by ceaseless wars and frenzied consumerism in the name of globalization and unipolar geopolitics, cannot produce a healthier society for humankind, in any part of the world.
