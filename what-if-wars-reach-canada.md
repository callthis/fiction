# What-if scenarios

## What if Canada was invaded in the coming months and years

A number of Canadian cities are located adjacent to wilderness that is likely to become extra dry due to climate change. The summer months are typically a season for wildfires in North America but with added challenges of extended droughts from changing climate, and greenhouse gasses that prevent rainfall, the coming months and years might become more problematic for various Canadian cities. 

Added to the challenge of wildfires impacting housing and residential areas, a number of industrial plants with hazardous chemicals are also likely to catch fire and cause tragic fallouts. 

Now, what if assailants or military strategists were planning methodical ways to corral people from burning cities to "safer" ones, and to then conduct missile attacks on those packed Canadian cities? 

Which assailants?? Which military strategists?? And why would they commit such violent attacks against civilians?! 

Which ones do *you* think are likely to do so, and by using intercontinental ballistic missiles? Particularly, try to guess which groups will buy into the rationale of "eliminating neo-nazis" as a motiviation for attacking a few crowded cities with few gigaton missiles, after setting blaze to the rest of the cities and pretending that it was wildfires. Doing something like that instead of attacking many cities with many missiles that could get blocked would more likely produce an outcome of "a decisive win against neo-nazis, once and for all." 

Then there are opportunistic groups throughout the world that could pretend to be the ones currently against neo-nazis, to attack Canadian cities for looting or pillaging. And there are also "patriotic" groups likely to conduct false-flag attacks so that their defense budget can be padded by a bunch of frightened bureaucrats in Canadian and American governments. 

There are so many possibilities here. So how many repetitions of Fort McMurray can Canada afford in the coming months and years?  

Oh! And, what if such wildfires were accompanied by new strains of fungi, bacteria and viruses? Something of that sort won't suddenly crash food markets during an oil crunch, will it? 

Canada is after all the soft underbelly of NATO â€” the soft, supple, and sordid underbelly. 

Canadian pinetree seeds from pine cones will grow out of the char-broiled dead bodies and ashes, not sunflower seeds. This is because, once a war starts, there are no good guys and bad guys, there are only alive people and dead people.
