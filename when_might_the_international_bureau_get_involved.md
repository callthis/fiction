## How and when might the International Bureau get involved in a case


Suppose, and I mean, suppose, a corporation in India has been cheating customers and amassing huge sums of unearned incomes each day, by cunningly overcharging innocent customers from local and international regions, while providing substandard goods and services. Now suppose, that same corporation has continued to embezzle that money by stashing and hiding it from the "Excise Duty and Income Tax Offices" of Central and State governments. Then, after doing such waywardly activities for more than a decade, the corporation becomes confident in running its operations by snaring the local police and various Commissionerates. That corporation then starts to conduct activities involving mafia tactics for abductions, multiple forms of extortion, imports and exports of goods without proper tax deductions, and other illicit trades across state and international borders. 

Subsequently, the corporation uses its unethical might and powers to manipulate the local police into having the sub-inspector and inspectors refuse and deny justice to complainants who request a First Information Record (FIR), to be filed against those types of corporations, or of any reported criminal incident pertaining to that "pioneering" corporation. The Police Commissionerates at the zonal, district and state level keep watching all of this without preventing or deterring these types of organized crimes. By orchestrating such ongoing tragedies against the public, alongside the exhaustion from the Covid pandemic that the public is already suffering from, the offending corporations also uses their clout to push around lawyers of complainants for an "out-of-the-court settlement." However, all such settlements of disputes and conflicts outside the courts, never seem to deter those corporate bosses from continuing their criminal activities, due to an absence of a public record of their hideous wrongdoings; and such a situation also allows other similar corporations to form an overall nexus of a crime syndicate, for market manipulation and price fixing.  

Thereafter, one fine day, the wrongdoers of such a dastardly corporation cause seriously grievous harm to a person and his clinically ill, bed-ridden, elderly widowed mother. 

The person struggles for more than a year to get the matter to even be heard at the applet courts while becoming poorer and more destitute. A group of corrupt and incompetent judges and their assistants block the filed complaint from ever reaching a stage of admission for a trial, by repeatedly disrupting the contents of the file, and by intentionally and forcefully steering the complainant away from the path of the law. The higher courts remain inaccessible, and the corruption within lower courts takes its toll on the hapless individuals who are owed long-overdue compensations. 

More particularly, within a certain lower court dressed up as a "quazi-judiciary forum", a culture of giving tribute or homage to the sitting judges dissuades and hurts the complainants who want to remain on the path of justice. That forum which intentionally protects the interests of corporate wrongdoers by screening them from any censure or legal punishments for their criminal activities, pushes around complaints against the interests of public justice by saying things like:

- The complaint is written in an emotional manner with "loquacity." 

- The relief requested by the complainant is "inadmissible." 

- The wording and paragraphs showcasing the criminality of the corporate entity, cannot be recognized by the forum (even though the statues allow the quazi judiciary forum to do so, via permission of Central Authority, when a cause of action arises from the submitted evidence in the filed complaint.) 
- *[The complainant is a "party in person" and a layperson without insider knowledge of how things work, particularly on how to appease us while filing the complaint by paying the solicited tribute.]*

Now, the bribes given to particular Commissionerates are often given as "money for 'Prasadam' to be placed before a temple's god." However, there has never been a deaf and dumb Godess in Hindu Mythology who would actually bless such illicit forms of accruing Prasadam. 

Obviously, any type of material goods or cash and cash equivalents become "washed and cleaned" after being "blessed" by the gods for blind devotees, especially for when that so-called Prasadam gets re-distributed to the network of advocates, judges, jurists, commissioners, state and municipal officers, and assistants within each of those compromised public sector offices. Of course, let's not forget the attenders in those offices who can otherwise scuttle a file through "clerical errors", upon being instructed by their superiors to do so via coded messages, if the members of the network aren't kept happy, content, and blissfully honoured. 

>Alas, sometimes the weight of a falling victim can cause an avalanche. The only thing those types of organization need to know is that, if Ravana had abducted Lord Rama's mother, Queen Kaushalya, then every version of Ramayan Geeth and Katha would have been drastically different, with the global hoard of Ravana's imps begging to be killed, and Lords Rama and Shiva not granting them the peace and mercy of death. 

This is where the Internal Affairs (IA) as well as the International Bureau (IB) get involved, when they detect the unearned incomes of a crime syndicate being laundered and "sanitized" via on-shore corporations and off-shore accounts. 

Suppose, and I mean, suppose, either or any of the network of pretentious cheats who were looting the public, got wind of the complaint filed against their bosses in a court of law from a gentle breeze, and the seriousness of the allegations along with the indisputable evidence contained therein, spooked them, then, perhaps they would have leaked that information and knowledge to their bosses. And then, maybe, the higher-ups in concert with their "consulting companies and senior advocates", would have shifted their stashed monies via corporate bonds and securities to places like London, Amstradam, Dubai or Singapore. 

You see, even with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and months of sustained manual labour, tallying millions of receipts to find the mechanism of how millions of Euros worth of Indian Rupees is being siphoned from on-shore slush funds to off-shore accounts, and then to other "stores of value", is rather tedious. But when, a smoked-out crime syndicate hastily calls a board meeting, due to state-wide alarm bells, so as to move all their hidden stash to off-shore accounts, because their General Board Meeting was about to happen on 23rd September (i.e. 23rd of this month), then, perhaps, their entire syndicated activities of misdeeds and violations, would have been lit up like fireworks in the darkest early hours after midnight, in a moonless sky.    

The moral of this story is that, not each crime syndicate's boss can simply escape like Vijay Malaya to crook-havens. And also that, each among the persons who have Labuored And Dredged Successfully in the rough, eventually earn a standard troy ingot of fine gold from the Canadian Mint or a pure 19 carat sapphire from their earnest work, with which they can obtain more meaningful and worthy living conditions in a healthier ecology.
