# What-if scenarios

## What if India sent peacekeeping troops to Eastern Europe?

What if, and I'm saying, what ifâ€¦ Indian armed forces were to establish an international peacekeeping mission in Moldova and support other East European countries as and when required. 

India is not Russia. India is not China. India is not Saudi Arabia. India is not the US, the UK or any European country. India is a democratic republic that is neutral to the conflicts in East Europe, and coincidentally, has hundreds of thousands of soldiers who can act as a buffer between EU nations and Russian protectorates. You know, just coincidentally. 

So, if the Indian peacekeeping forces were on the ground in Eastern Europe, they would only need to provide basic protective, patrolling, and medical aid services to victims of the current invasion of Ukraine that is about to spill over into other parts of Eastern Europe like Hungary and Romania. 

Technically, Moldova would be ideal as it isn't so contentious to establish a base of command for UN armed forces there compared to Poland, Hungary, Austria and Romania. The EU has already started to increase its troop presence in those contentious countries in case Article Five of the NATO alliance has to be invoked. This move by the EU only looks like an invitation for (taunt against) Russians to invade Hungary, Poland, and Romania.  

So, which other UN Security Council Member is as nonpartisan as India in the context of the ongoing war along EU borders, to be elected as a referee. It would be much more suitable for Indian armed forces to deescalate the situation around Ukraine while maintaining a firm stance against imperialism and colonialism. For both imperialism and colonialism only lead to slavery and crimes against humanity.
