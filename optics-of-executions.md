## The Optics of Capital Punishment via Beheading

This article is to be viewed in the context of a group of veterans from Indian armed forces being held in Qatar, who have been sentenced to death by *a court of First Instance* of Qatar's judiciary, presumably on charges of espionage. 

Now, let's consider the optics of, beheading people.

Specifically, within nation-states or city-states that have adopted an official religion for the state's citizenship, the penal-code of that polity might include sentencing for high crimes and high misdemeanors, with a capital punishment. Such penal sentences might be given by a court by citing religious scriptures as a source, or as a justification for the precedence in prescribing death, for certain proscribed human behaviors. 

So, if a judiciary finds that a provable crime is of an atrocious and heinous nature, that the irreparable damage done to the state's people by the committed crime is profound, that the criminal cannot be reformed, and that a measure of deterrence needs to be added to the sentencing to prevent those types of crimes from being committed, ever again, by putting the criminal to death, then, the judiciary is still faced with the question of how to actually execute the criminal. Particularly, the court needs to find a way to carry out the execution, without committing a crime against God, country, humanity, and against the basic worth and dignity, of human life. This is because, the very same religious scriptures also provide precautionary advice on being weary of sadistic, opportunistic, or incompetent officials, who can abuse government statutes to get away with murder, by framing an innocent person as a villainous, unrepentant reprobate. Those types of officials can and have used their head-of-state, as a rubber stamp or as a totem pole, to get away with their wrongful deeds, which their head-of-state would not have approved of, had that incumbent leader been actually aware of things being carried out in their name, and with their official stamp of approval. 

Is it supposed to be ironic if bad court officials who have abused their seat of authority to commit executions, get executed via an inquisition for those crimes? 

In many countries, historically, the 'merciful and humane' method for carrying out executions has been to either behead, shoot, or to hang the person sentenced to death, so that the form of death given to the 'irredeemable' criminal, isn't cruel and prolonged with agony. However, too often, bullets from a firing squad cause the person to die slowly by bleeding to death, and hanging can be swift only if the spine is severed at the neck due to the sudden jerking motion of the rope pulling at a sufficiently heavy body. Otherwise, during a hanging, the person can choke to death after struggling for minutes, and sometimes, even up to half an hour. 

For such, 'technical reasons', the Nazis had experimented with, and eventually popularized *the gas-chamber,* because they wanted to be efficient and frugal, while committing genocides and mass killings. Those Nazis thought that they were doing a humane and a good thing, by softly and politely killing people, that they had decided to criminalize and pathologize, "for purifying their 'Aryan race'." 

When the electric chair was invented, many countries in the Americas adopted that method for executions, only to realize that it was as horrifyingly cruel, as putting people to death by burning them alive. Many of those states and provinces in the Americas, [and various other countries of the world,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment#Contemporary_use) switched to biochemical methods of castration, mutilation, lobotomy, and-or killing, but with grievous harms done repeatedly, each year, to numerous wrongfully detained people within each of those countries, by corrupt or incompetent officials.  

Of course, there were the more draconian methods of impalement, stoning, starving, pushing from a height, or crushing people to death, as a "legalized punitive option 'to restore peace and order in society'." Those methods have been abandoned by, I would like to say... all countries of the world? Most probably all countries of the world have finally, oh wait, no, Afghanistan is still stuck in the tragic era of Edwardian justice system. 

However, the act of shoving nails through the [interosseos nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interosseous_nerve) at the wrists of a person (no, not the palms, the wrists), to then have that person strung onto a t-shaped or a cross-shaped frame of wood by those nails, was abandoned after a king called [Pontius Piate](https://www.history.com/news/why-pontius-pilate-executed-jesus) did it to an innocent person. That particular innocent person had claimed to be a threshold guardian of this realm, and had voiced to the public of his era that departed souls would need to pass via the guarded threshold towards God, through him. He might have been saying the truth, who knows, right? (Istagfir Allah, ya Allah, istagfir.) 

By the way, have I mentioned previously in any of my writings that I'm not within Christ nor is Christ within me, but I'm not without Christ? I might as well mention it here. 

So, have we as a global human society, come far from stripping a criminal naked, and then tarring and feathering that person, to parade them in the streets as an approach to "justice?" No, we haven't yet evolved to a better stage of human and societal evolution than what the world was during the feudal era. But, why? 

The world is still draconian in many of its ways because there are still too many countries which think that a life for a life, is an equitable form of "remedy", and that some type of torment or torture along with humiliation, must be prescribed against culprits, for any and all punishable wrongdoings and offenses. Those countries and their citizens, aren't interested in the actual concepts of remedy, reconciliation, or restorative justice; they are only interested in the concepts of brutality, retribution, and retaliatory justice. These two forms of justice, are not equal, nor are they equivalent in any sense of the word of equivalence. Only one of those forms of justice, is truly humanitarian, but is far more economically expensive than the other. 

In various economically poor countries, the value of a human life can be less than that of a fist full of asbestos, so the preference to execute criminals is prioritized, and the example set by the judiciary of those countries for its peoples, is to use similar forms of quick-and-dirty punishments to deal with issues at the family and neighborhood level of society, within the homes and cities of denizens in those countries. I shall not name any of those countries to provide an example, but you can most probably guess the ones other than Afghanistan, that I'm alluding to. 

Then there are economically rich or opulent countries, which still use capital punishment along with using various dirty methods of abusing medical sciences and state-sponsored mechanisms, as punitive measures against criminalized or pathologized behaviors, because a number of influential leaders and officials in those countries continue to vehemently maintain such cruel methods through statutory norms and regulations. Those types of leaders and officials, want to get rid of the people they deem as a burden to their society, and also the people they deem as a "political threat" to their incumbency. The judiciary in such countries, sets an example for its country's residents, to adopt more subtle and seemingly "objective" ways of administering punitive measures as a means to enforce changes in people's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Again, let me refrain from naming names of those countries and individuals, even though the rest of my writings posted online, do point rather squarely at some of them with evidence of how abuses of official powers and fiduciary roles are being systematically committed by certain groups, particularly against Muslims and peoples of color, due to racially or politically motivated discrimination against targeted individuals and communities, within those countries. 

Somehow, providing education to, and distancing the culprit from mainstream society in a safe manner, isn't a priority in those countries, because people of those countries do see retribution as a more powerful, moral, and as "a meaningful" form of ethical justice. They simply prize killing or torturing a known criminal to gain closure, and as a form of societal achievement, and also as a form of doing a patriotic good deed, for their kith-and-kin. Why wouldn't they be as such? Why wouldn't one be vindictive against treasonous cheats, gang rapists, serial murderers, and roving marauders? Perhaps, a person who doesn't want to copy the means and methods of those types of criminals to justify their personal goals, would take a path that is markedly different, than the one taken by those who fuel the vicious cycles of feudalistic wars and inequity. What other way can there be, to avoid anthropological cycles that are driven by individualistic greed for power and monopoly.  

This is why, I must ask any persons from Qatar's government who may come to read this, especially if this article is contained within an intelligence report given to them at their office desk: 

>"What do you suppose will be more fitting in the eyes of those who care about restoration and reconciliation?" 

This question is particularly important in the context of imprisoned people being accused and detained on charges of espionage, because the burden of proof, when taken by the state to prove criminality of the accused, is often only taken in rem, and in secrecy, usually via the authority of a tribunal, far away from the public's watchful eye. Do you genuinely think that people from India will ever accept or excuse the execution of a group of people, without ever knowing the complete details about why such an act was carried out by the incumbent Qatari government? 

Following that legalized homicide, would it ever be possible to repair or normalize the relationships between India and Qatar, imagine if all the Qatari government had against those Naval veterans as evidence, was a testimony of 'a witness', that those Indian workers were 'shamelessly spying', with no other tangible or verifiable evidence of the allegations; if Qatar were to go ahead and kill people on such tenuous and flimsy grounds of a "trespass or a transgression", how many nations would continue to send their citizens as visitors, students, workers, or delegates to Qatar, ever again? How would Qatar manage to differentiate itself from Oman, Iran, or Libya? 

Also, wouldn't people wonder if the Qatari government and armed forces merely exploited Indian migrant workers, to then come up with a fabricated excuse to kill those Indians out of malice, or out of jealousy from the expertise and skills possessed by those Indians, so that those exceptionally skilled workers would not be able to ever reveal their true and personal experiences to anyone, from having worked in Qatar's defense and naval industry sectors? 

Moreover, does the Qatari government intend to return the bodies of those ex-servicemen, if it carries out the serial executions? What type of a funeral would they be given if Qatari officials don't return the bodies to India? Or does Qatar intend to chalk all of this out to a martial act of justice, and then expect the Indian government to regard it as some type of "a cost of doing business", or as a form of "acceptable collateral damage", from having international and trade relationships with Qatar? 

Is someone in Qatar, or in an influential foreign group trying to make Qatar go to war with India? How would they succeed in doing anything more than damaging the trade relationships between the two countries? Is that their main aim in having Qatar execute India's skilled workers? 

India will have to evacuate all Indians from Qatar, and halt all immigration procedures involving that country, if relationships become more strained. Imagine the hit Qatar Airways, and even Etihad as well as Emirates Airways would take, because of Indians not traveling to, or via Qatar, due to merely that much of a travel advisory being implemented by the Indian government? 

Plus, what type of precautions will other countries need to adopt when sending any skilled workers or tourists to Qatar? 

Indeed, Qatar has had the opportunity for becoming the preferred destination for hosting international sports, e-sports, Formula-1 racing championships, off-road racing events, for medical tourism, and for resolving international disputes via its equitable courts. Courts constituted within a special economic zone of Qatar, could be more suitable for resolving disputes and conflicts for which the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) cannot be petitioned, because of their inability to address state-sponsored crimes committed by American entities. Believing in the impartiality of the ICC and the ICJ, in cases that they do have the ability to work on, is also difficult when genocidal activities, human rights violations, and crimes against humanity involving religious discrimination and sectarian violence are committed against Muslims. However, if Qatar cannot prove that its courts have a standard above and beyond those of the ECJ, then it will obviously need to continue to rely on tourism and fossil fuel exports, as a way to distinguish and compete among emerging powers of the world. 

Being on the right or wrong side of history is only discernible in hindsight, decades after an incident has occurred. Therefore, which side of history would the people of Qatar like to be on? 

>One does not need to kill or devour a buddha, if one happens to meet a buddha on the street. Whether one meets an [Angulimaala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E1%B9%85gulim%C4%81la#Life_as_a_brigand), or the Buddha, one only needs to say Namaste to each, and then continue on their own path. Both, Angulimaala and the Buddha, will only do what they were meant to do, when they crossed paths with you.
