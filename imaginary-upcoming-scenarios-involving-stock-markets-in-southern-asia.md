## Imaginary Upcoming Scenarios Involving Stock Markets in Southern Asia


Right after the Friday afternoon closing bell on the share markets in India...

The cyber-attacks in the form of high volume, high frequency, short-seller activities from international brokerages will do the first wave of damage. The more serious damage to the Indian economy which, won't be repairable within the next two decades, will occur because of actions taken by Moody's and S&P, in downgrading ratings of all investment funds that have any components linked to "CGHS and ECHS"[^1]. 

Fitch Group may or may not follow suit immediately, with the other two credit ratings companies. Each of those ratings companies, individually, and in concert, will eventually show their "international 'rules' based" justice and fairness to India, in protecting the turf of western investors within the global, insurance and credit industry. 

In the mean time, while millions of unassuming Indian citizens continue to be dependent on CGHS and ECHS for healthcare insurance, various incumbent ministers from the Government of India involved in the "ghotala" of robbing those millions of citizens, will try to downplay the situation by saying something to the effect of, "It is all in control, this is a nominal issue, and we should not panic." 

Not a single Indian citizen is interested in panicking about the realities of daily life, because such news is merely as expected and is business as usual. There is nothing surprising or interesting about a foundational component of a country's banking and insurance industry being identified as defective or broken. It simply needs to be replaced with a functional complainant and then India's revived healthcare system can be reconstituted under better regulations.
