## The value of things and intelligence 

How does one avoid underestimating or overestimating the value of a thing or an event, while assessing and evaluating it, in the light of a given context? 

More often than not, the above question is taken in the context of self-worth, or in the context of one's own rectitude in terms of intelligence, morality, aesthetic outlook, and capacity to handle upcoming future events. Likewise, it can also be posited in the context of risk assessment of a situation, or value judgments ascribed to entities like people, places, corporations, as well as other living and non-living things. In all such varied context, the often neglected question is, "Assessment of things with respect to which exact datum?" 

So, evaluating human intelligence might be easier, when compared to that of plants and trees. For example, one can notice that plants and trees are intelligent enough to know what not to do, and how not to pollute. Human beings have not yet to figured out how to live harmoniously on Earth without polluting it, and are less intelligent than zoo-spores, phytoplankton, plants, and trees when it comes to knowing, "How to not pollute or defile, the microcosm we happen to live in?"

Similarly, to have intelligence of a cow, one would need to have all the structural and functional components of a cow's metabolism. Following such line of thought and reasoning, we can discern the fact that, each creature's capacity and capabilities depend upon its individual form of metabolism and ecology, which, coincidentally, it did not create via its own fiat, prior to coming into existence. Mu (void).[^1] 

In any case, one can notice that human cognition is not feasible without human metabolism. Without human metabolism, there is no human, hence, no human intelligence. Without healthy metabolism within a healthy ecology, how can there be healthy thoughts and actions? So then, isn't thinking, in itself, an action or an activity? 

While researching the topic of intelligence from a cognitive science perspective, one is likely to come across phrases like, "goal directed behavior of a living being is evidence of that being's intelligence." Supposedly, the self-actualized being has sufficient sense of how to formulate a goal which, isn't strictly a function of the being's "local circumstances." This type of a definition is even adopted in defining Artificial Intelligence (AI), to suggest that any mechanized and non-biological form of goal directed behavior exhibited by an electro-mechanical system, is also a form of intelligence. 

In all such phrases and wording about intelligence, more peculiar questions arise, such as: what is life; what is self; how local in space and time is sufficiently local; and what types of overt behaviors exemplify movement of a being towards a short-term or a long-term goal? 

Is simply breathing, in a meditative posture, a goal worth setting and achieving? Perhaps for utilitarians who haven't died sufficiently many times, mere existence doesn't appear to be much of an achievement. 

Now, how will you recognize death? 

Well, did you recognize that the previous moment in time died, and the current version of you didn't even actively feel or focus on how a transition occurred in you, from one instance of time, into another, without you needing to control the flow of time? 

The past has ceased to exist but its evidence is available in the present. The future has yet to exist but its potential exists in the present. How we honor the past, and recognize a path towards a possible future, gives meaning to the present. Not knowing how to, or not being able to read the present, leads to a sense of loss â€” of meaning.

    Here, certain rude sounding words are placed adjacent to more philosophically profound concepts regarding "truth" and sacred aspects of human experience, because the things that seem to appear important and significant, are always subjectively found in the context of remaining things, which appear unimportant and not so meaningful. It is up to you to decide what is or isn't valuable to you, and whether you will be able to live with consequences of your decisions.
