## International Rules-based Order, Question Mark 

Using the phrase, "agreement-based interactions", can be a better way to discuss nuances of ongoing changes within the our world's geo-political stage and international arena. This could be specially useful, compared to hemming and hawing, or fuming and fussing about the natural-consequence-based changes, that are currently occurring within the so-called "international, rules-based order." 

Disarmament and agreement-based meetings, can most certainly incorporate aspects of competition and complementary behaviors among multi-ethnic and multi-national parties, without formal allegiances or treaties governing those interactions. Admittedly, disagreement-based interactions can become naturally confrontational, though they need not be. But more importantly, the likelihood of cyber-warfare-based attacks escalating into different forms of armed conflicts, and even into animosity laden hostilities, is definitely palpable and measurable. 

Specifically, Canadian incumbent government's behaviors and conduct, still cannot be squarely forgiven, because of their unrepentant and contemptuous stance in withholding their public admission of guilt, and because of their conceited act of not taking forthright responsibility towards paying for their liabilities, and culpability, in harboring latent hostilities; all of which, have continued to produce overt as well as clandestine genocidal activities being committed by Canadian state-sponsored actors, against peoples of color and people with non-Anglo-Saxon heritage.  

More generally though, the concept of "rules" for many individuals who belong to western geo-political alliances, merely means any set of "if-then statements." For those people, any "if" can be followed with any "then." This is the mechanistic approach to predicate logic, where a statement beginning with the linguistic clause of, "if", can logically imply, any other statement beginning with the linguistic clause of, "then." 

Examples of first order predicate logic include: 

a) If it rains today in Madrid, Spain, then I will buy a lottery ticket from Macao, China. 

b) If government officials from neutral countries like India, do not proactively change their stance to become distinctly friendly to NATO in their public outlook and statements, then they will be declared as misfits, who will also be turned away from, shunned during, or even derided in meetings with European and North American alliances, via overt as well as covert actions.

Readers of this article might note that statement (a), in the above-mentioned example, sounds like a superstition because, it is. Readers might also note that statement (b), sounds like a pretentious and coercive threat, because, it is. 

You as the reader, would most certainly be correct, in such observations. 

The clever, and rather underhanded method of disguising imposed rules as mere if-then statements, is to be able to mask blatantly racist hegemony, bigotry, hostility, and also unethical inducements in the form of bribery, as normalized or official practices, presented using placid or innocuous sounding policies, documents, and statements. 

In contrast to people who find emotional and patriotic sentiments as a hindrance or a hurdle to propagating uni-polar geo-politics, for many persons from ancient cultures of the world, a statement that can be legitimately categorized as a rule, must be justifiable in an ethical and authentic way by demonstrating how and why a given policy is fair, and equitable, with respect to the people and ecology that will eventually or inadvertently bear its impacts. Proper rules that govern human activities, demonstrate entailment, not mere assertions based on some overlord's whims. As such, arbitrary if-then statements lacking entailment, do not belong in the category known as societal laws, norms, and rules, even if numerous computer science and political theorists from westernized countries tend call any set of if-then statements as, "rules." 

Production rules are also known as "condition-action" rules, whereby, sets of statements that describe known conditions or patterns, directly imply or lead to, predetermined actions for generating predicted or estimated outcomes. The following definition from online Oxford Reference, explains the concept of production rules — 

> A programming language [or a paradigm,] in which the programs [or routines,] consist of condition ⇒ action rules; these rules are known as productions or production rules. The programs [or routines,] are processed by an *interpreter* which repeats the following operations: 
> - all rules whose conditions are satisfied are found (rule matching), 
> - one of them is selected (conflict resolution), and its action is called (rule firing). 
>
>Such systems are often known as rule-based systems in artificial intelligence and form the basis of many expert systems.

For quite a few people in this world who happen to occupy seats of authority and influence, a system comprising of mathematically logical statements and procedures, that is completely 'sanitized' to become devoid of human emotions and sentiments, in an industrially sterile way, is somehow better than all other systems that can be utilized for governing human-human interactions within the universe. Such people would rather see human beings behave as automatons devoid of artistic creativity and intuition, simply because of their lack in capacity to handle their own emotional state of being, as well as their lack of ability to appreciate other people's range of emotional sentiments. Those types of people who lack inter-cultural competencies are thoroughly convinced, that anything done via emotionally primed motivations, or activities which include the display of emotionally "charged" expressions, is an affront to "productivity", and must thereby, be immediately quashed by force. Their emotional sense of loss, based on a supposed disruption to their desired or expected financial gains from a potential future, is somehow never evident to them as an emotion, that they ought to manage, in a more healthy and culturally productive way. If you, as the reader of this article, <ins>are not</ins> one of those types of people, then congratulations for being a sensitive human, as opposed to an insensitive human or a piece of software. 

Measures of productivity in all such non-humanitarian and non-humanistic, rules-based arrangements, are of course, only financial in nature, and they do not accommodate any measures of social impact, spiritual upliftment, or of emotional satisfaction; simply because spirituality is considered to be entirely imaginary or delusional, and emotions are considered to be "a bad thing", by people who follow those types of automated systems designs to guide their life. But the most problematic outcome of their behaviors is that they don't only follow such inhumane designs, they prescribe it forcefully upon other people and even nations, because they are convinced that they are the supreme, 'unbiased' arbiters and judges of all entities and processes existent in the universe. 

Indeed, any dissenting individual who disagrees with them on any matter of opinion or factual data, is swiftly and automatically pathologized, or criminalized by them. 

Also, simplistic inconsistencies or ambiguities within sets of rules styled as, go-no-go actions, can lead to unpredictable, and sudden, failures. Such rule-based systems are fragile and lack resiliency, to properly handle stochastic phenomena within the natural world. This has continuously led to gross mismanagement of environmental and cultural needs of governed human beings. 

Therefore, the utterly hapless approach prescribed by emotionally stunted people, for interacting with nature and with its constituents, need not be taken as the ultimate standard for creating a governing framework among trans-continental societies. Cold-hearted, purely predicate logic based instruments, mechanisms, and [finite-state-automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), happen to be the most crude and rudimentary ways for creating systems or frameworks, which have till date, only produced miserably faulty machines labeled as "expert systems." 

Mechanistic people who believe that the universe we live in, is nothing but a soulless computer simulation in the form of a finite-state-machine, possibly cannot appreciate the essence of our humanity that makes us *humane beings,* due to their obliviousness. Those types of people, must not be placed in-charge of anything that produces direct or indirect consequences upon living beings. 

In conclusion, countries like India need not budge even a single inch, in the face of duress or any other types of calmly stated threats and corrupting motions involving bribes. Most importantly, in regards to ongoing international negotiations, suitable forms of justified defensive actions are necessarily to be put into effect, against countries that incubate, or support, groups which conduct terror, sabotage, or separatism based activities across borders. Such considered actions can be deployed in reciprocity to condition-action rules, that those offending and offensive countries happen to be so truly, fond of.
