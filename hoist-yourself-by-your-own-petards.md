## Hoist Yourself by Your Own Petards

Suppose, a number of "military contractors" in South America regularized their activities, by registering a private company and by using a payroll management software to make themselves look like hired or employed workers of a legitimate corporation. Then suppose, the human resources and payroll management software was a common one, such as the software modules provided by Zoho or Sales Force for managing business operations; following which, thousands of records of individuals with military or para-military training became shown to the public as ordinary workers or consultants, of one or the other private company, using a commercial off the shelf software for managing those human resources. Finally, suppose that private investors from Canada and America decided to invest in the South American companies that have been managing so-called civilian human resources, out of pure greed for money, because those Canadian and American investors saw the potential for exponential growth in various sectors of South and Central American industries, particularly because of the growing number of "employed and employable" individuals being managed by a number of seemingly ordinary firm. 

Now, suppose, those mercenary units and ex-soldiers were to hold a serious grudge against people like Americans, Canadians, and against "capitalists", because leaders of those capitalists have for decades, meddled with and sabotaged the peaceful functioning of governments and civic institutions in Central and South America.  

Would it be tragic, surprising, annoying, or ironic, that North American investors have been investing in the strengthening companies, which in turn, intend to destroy American and Canadian interests, especially in Venezuela and Guyana.    

The more important and specific industry sectors being promoted and protected by those armed, private security groups in the Caribbean as well as in Central and South America, that are being bolstered by North American investors, happen to include:

- Armaments sector 
  - Heavy armaments and firearms are mainly imported or smuggled into Central and South American countries from a large variety of foreign ones including China 
  - Production of munitions and modification of small firearms

  - Clandestine forms of human trafficking into North America as, "recruitment of young models or athletes who 'may' competitively earn professional contract work with North American brand and sports teams" 
    - Forced contraception and body shaping procedures imposed on the trafficked individuals, including teenagers, is one of the most problematic yet hidden aspects of sports and modeling sector
  
- Antique and heritage artifacts sector
  - A wide range of items smuggled or trafficked into North America via complex network of people and corporate entities for auction houses, museums, and private collectors 
  
- Exotic animals sector 
  - Smuggling of aquatic and terrestrial animals from Central and South America to various countries, through the support of intermediaries and business agencies 
  
Areas where North American investors are not keen on funding or even dipping their toes into, include schooling and higher education sectors that aren't lucrative. Social services sector, community support, and prenatal care are the types of things left to philanthropic investors who priorities political and social return on investment over financial returns. 

The above set of behaviors of various North American investors relies on the age-old colonial design of focusing only on promoting certain types of foreign direct investments, into particular areas of industry, that do not directly produce local socio-economic upliftment or knowledge transfer, while generating exploitable and exportable equities.
