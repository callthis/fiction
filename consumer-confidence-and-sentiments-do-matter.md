## Consumer Confidence and Sentiments Do Matter

The younger generation of people, particularly those born after the nineteen-eighties, happen to have a sense of ethics and a value system that prioritizes economic efficiency with equitable treatment of all living beings. Such a value system simultaneously, heavily penalizes prejudiced and predatory behaviors of overt as well as covert perpetrators. 

Especially, the exploitation, abuse, rape, or killing of vulnerable people such as minorities, children, the elderly, the disabled, or the infirm, are more severely penalized via social mechanisms of denying respect and adoration to offenders, apart from public censures and admonishments enforced upon the identified perpetrators through all necessary legal means. Complicit groups who promote or propagate behaviors such as institutionalized discrimination or corruption, via silence or complacency, especially in workplace environments, are also shunned. 

Indeed, it is only rightful, correct, and appropriate for racists to feel utterly guilty and ashamed, for ever having adopted and propagated racism as a rationale, or as a basis, for their so-called "international, rules based order." 

The direct, willful and cheerful cooperation of succeeding generations of global leaders and rulers, in properly repaying the debt owed from long-overdue reparations, while completely effacing racism and other forms of bigotry from Earth, is therefore, the only rational path forward, towards genuine peace and reconciliation. 

As such, any monarchies, corporations, or other types of "traditional" institutions that are out of touch with key sentiments espoused by younger generation of people, are likely to slip away into oblivion, as those obsolete institutions continue to become ever more irrelevant to the daily lives of younger people, especially to the lives of those younger people who care about a cleaner, peaceful, and an egalitarian ecology, from an existential stand point and necessity.
