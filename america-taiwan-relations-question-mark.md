## America-Taiwan Relations, Question Mark 

American lawmakers and government officials have never truly believed and honestly stated that the island or region of Taiwan, is an authentic and legally constituted sovereign country on Earth, due to its own right and freedom to be as such. They have only believed and stated that they will "support" whatever it is that Taiwan happens to be, as long as it is profitable and suitable for those American leaders to maintain their self-proclaimed image as the 'uni-polar' world's most dominant, 'Supreme Overlord and Highest Super Power.'  

More factually and specifically, the individuals from the US government who drafted, legislated, and enacted America's *"Taiwan Relations Act (1979)",* did not believe that there was any such thing known as the "Taiwanese polity" which was of a sovereign nation called Taiwan, especially not in the way they believed the American polity to have already been in existence by belonging to, and hailing from, a sovereign nation called the United States of America. Those legislators instead believed that the people who lived on the island of Taiwan, could be merely referred to as "people on Taiwan"; irrespective of the status of the region often referred to by them as "Taipei", being either a sovereign nation with proper statehood, or a province belong to the People's Republic of China. 

The above fact is evidenced in the way the wording, ***"...relations between the people <ins>of</ins> the United States and the people <ins>on</ins> Taiwan..."*** is used in the *Taiwan Relations Act (1979).* 

Could you imagine that type of a language being used by American lawmakers in referring to the Swedish people as people on Sweden, Singaporeans as people on Southern tip of Malaysia, Australians as non-Kiwis on Northern border of Antarctica, or Brazilians as Latinos on Amazonian River basin? 

Or, would American legislators and congressional ministers possibly ever refer to the Saudis from Saudi Arabia in a legal document as, people on the Arabian Peninsula; along with the Omani, Yemeni, Emiraati, Kuwaiti, Qatari, and Bahranian peoples as yet another group of humans on the Arabian Subcontinent? 

Such types of diplomatic double speak and equivocation, embedded within the text of American statutes like the *Taiwan Relations Act (1979),* is conveniently used by [legal positivists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_positivism) in America, to gain undue advantages during negotiations involving foreign affairs, whenever it suits them to do so. Legal positivists assert that only the letter of the existing laws need to be taken into consideration, instead of the anthropological context about the purposes of why and how they were enacted. 

However, when the literal text of a given statute, such as the *Taiwan Relations Act (1979),* indicates that the meaning of the phrase, "Taiwan's people", as contained and utilized within it, does not properly define those people as a nationalized polity belonging to a sovereign nation-state called Taiwan, especially in comparison to the people of the US of A, then those legal positivists conveniently take a step back from asserting their style of legal formalism, and allow their colleagues from America's current version of [legal realism and instrumentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_formalism#Comparison_to_legal_instrumentalism) to take center stage, for arguing that historical connotations do need to be taken into consideration, particularly when the topic of discussion is about defining the maritime borders of the People's Republic of China. 


>The US in the meantime, is encouraging Taiwan to purchase "use-and-throw weaponry", instead of anything substantial that could be captured and reverse engineered by the Chinese. There is also the typical distrust among American strategists of all their client-states, in the sense that, "What if American advanced military technologies were to be leaked to the Chinese, upon being sold to people [stationed] on Taipei." 
>
>Those military strategists might even try to justify their need to withhold trust, in their clients, by suggesting how previously sold defense systems to Taiwan were soon afterwards found to be replicated by the People's Liberation Army. And more specifically because, who can anybody be certain whether people living on that island are, or are not, Chinese to begin with?

American government's approach to international relationships has remained the same as it was, during and prior to the US-Russia Cold War era, which has been to sow seeds of discord and doubt among America's non-allies, and often, even among allies to keep them in a subordinate position via "information asymmetry." The main purpose of that approach has been to increase chaos and confusion among nations of the world to keep them divided; and to "reserve 'the right'" to play whichever card that the American agencies may feel like playing, whenever it suits them, particularly for gaining undue and unearned advantages, even if those cards are irreconcilably opposed and contradictory. Being sneaky, dishonest, underhanded, insincere, surreptitious, divisive, disingenuous, dastardly, and conniving, while bending and breaking 'the international rules of the game', by simultaneously putting into effect any strategy or tactic, which would otherwise be hypocritical and wrongful of all other nations to use, is the only demonstrably consistent reality of the American government's conduct in various matters concerning the wellness of humanity as a whole, and of life's global ecology. 

Such ignoble and unjust behaviors driven by greed among various educational, religious, industrial, and socio-political leaders from North America, which have continuously produced inter-generational harms against a greater majority of the world's nations, has been especially to the detriment of all civilizations that are not: Euro-centric and subservient to Anglo-Saxon worldviews. 

The most important time for America's people to introspect and reflect upon, in order to suitably change and depart from the illegitimate, degrading, and dishonorable things that a number of their current and previous office bearers, and thought leaders from government as well as non-government organizations have wreaked upon the world, is now.

#### Let's get meta with this article 

The following type of results can be obtained, if you feed the last three paragraphs of the above text as a document for content and sentiment analysis, into a commercial AI software like: 

- IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding 

    - It finds the document's sentiment to be significantly positive, and you might be surprised by what kinds of phrases and sentences it seems to find positive. I certainly was. 
	
	- For sentiment analysis of a given text, the score is from -1 to 1.
	
	```
	{
	  "sentiment": {
		"document": {
		  "score": 0.433172,
		  "mixed": "1",
		  "label": "positive"
		}
	  }
	}
	```
	
    - Category label scores of a given text are from 0 to 1.
    - The category labels ascribed to given text are: 
    
    ```
	{
	  "categories": [
		{
		  "score": 0.867021,
		  "label": "/news and politics/politics"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.821197,
		  "label": "/news and politics/politics/political issues"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.708663,
		  "label": "/news and politics/politics/war and conflicts"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.682005,
		  "label": "/business and finance/economy/financial reform"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.652868,
		  "label": "/news and politics/international news"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.582426,
		  "label": "/news and politics/law"
		}
	  ]
	}
	```

- Google Natural Language API V2

    - It finds the document's sentiment to be strongly negative (very close to maximum negative score), and I was a bit surprised by how drastically negative it scored the given text. I couldn't figure out how to obtain the json format of its analytical outputs, but this is what it provided: 
	
	- Entire Document's Sentiment: 
	
	  - Score = -0.934 && Magnitude = 3.944
	  
	  - "Score" is supposed to be from -1 to +1 while "Magnitude" is from 0 to +inf. 
	
	- Categories: 
	
	  - "/People & Society/Social Sciences/Political Science" && Score = 0.8092402
	  
	  - "/Law & Government/Government/Other" && Score = 0.1703827
	  
	  - "/News/Politics/Other" && Score: 0.11693627
	  
	  - Here the score for categorizing a given text is from 0 to 1.


All of the above scores among both AI, signify a statistical confidence level, and there is no easy way to decide what level of precision after the decimal point on those numerical values actually matters in terms of statistical sensitivity and physical meaningfulness. 

I, as the author though, would say that this is my writing style where I intend to be neutral, by positing opinions which naturally sound negatively valanced about "various but not all" American states-persons, as a critique of their publicly apparent conduct; to then make a closing statement in the final paragraph that sounds more positive and hopeful. 

The last three paragraphs of this article's main content can also be obtained as a URL, to feed it to an AI in plain text - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callthis/fiction/master/meta/america-taiwan-relations-question-mark.txt 

So, comparing the two commercial AI, I would say that IBM Watson does a better job at finding the intended category labels; whereas Google's Natural Language API didn't detect the topics of "war and conflict" as well as "financial reform" (or more accurately, political reform). And bother of them failed to identify the category of "International Affairs." 

Unfortunately, popular AI have not yet been trained to detect content that is supposed to be humorous or sarcastic, within a given content's tone and sentiment, which would be a more fine-grained analysis than simplistic labels of "positive vs negative." However, I would say that both IBM's and Google's AI missed the mark on labeling the content as neutral, or slightly negative. Of course, by no means was this article's content about positively praising any particular entity. For sure! LOL :laughing:
