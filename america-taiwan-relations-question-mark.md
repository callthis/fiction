## America-Taiwan Relations, Question Mark 

<sub><b>Author: Sameer Khan | Published Online: 23-09-2024 | Edited version: 27-09-2025</b></sub>

American lawmakers and government officials have never truly believed and honestly stated that the island or region of Taiwan, is an authentic and legally constituted sovereign country on Earth, due to its own right and freedom to be as such. Those American senators and officials have only believed and stated that they will "support" whatever it is that Taiwan happens to be, as long as it is profitable and suitable for the American government to maintain America's self-proclaimed image as the 'uni-polar' world's most dominant, 'Supreme Overlord and Highest Super Power.'  

More factually and specifically, the individuals from the US government who drafted, legislated, and enacted America's *"Taiwan Relations Act (1979)",* did not believe that there was any such thing known as the "Taiwanese polity" which was of a sovereign nation called Taiwan, especially not in the way they believed the American polity to have already been in existence by belonging to, and hailing from, a sovereign nation called the United States of America. Those American legislators instead believed that the people who lived on the island of Taiwan, could merely be referred to as "people on Taiwan"; irrespective of the status of the region often referred to, by them, as "Taipei." The topic of Taipei being either a sovereign nation with proper statehood, or a province belong to the People's Republic of China has always been deliberately kept within a limbo by those American legislators, for their own selfish and self-centered designs. 

The above fact is evidenced in the way the wording, ***"...relations between the people <ins>of</ins> the United States and the people <ins>on</ins> Taiwan..."*** is used in the *Taiwan Relations Act (1979).* 

Could you imagine that type of a language being used by American lawmakers in referring to the Swedish people as people on Sweden, Singaporeans as people on Southern tip of Malaysia, or Brazilians as Brownish and Blackish people on Amazonian River basin, or Australians as non-Kiwi-non-Chilean-non-Argentine neighbors on [Antarctica](https://youtu.be/T0qRoeEcKtY?t=123)'s borders? 

Or, would American legislators and congressional ministers possibly ever refer to the Saudis from Saudi Arabia in a legal document as, people on the Arabian Peninsula; along with the Omani, Yemeni, Emiraati, Kuwaiti, Qatari, Bahranian, and Jordanian peoples as, yet another group of humans on the Arabian Subcontinent? 

Such types of diplomatic double speak and equivocation, embedded within the text of American statutes like the *Taiwan Relations Act (1979),* is conveniently used by [legal positivists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_positivism) in America, to gain undue advantages during negotiations involving foreign affairs, whenever it suits them to do so. Legal positivists assert that only the letter of the existing laws need to be taken into consideration, instead of the anthropological context about the purposes for why and how those laws were enacted. 

However, when the literal text of a given statute, such as the *Taiwan Relations Act (1979),* indicates that the meaning of the phrase, "Taiwan's people", as contained and utilized within it, does not properly define those people as a nationalized polity belonging to a sovereign nation-state called Taiwan, especially in comparison to the people of the US of A, then those legal positivists conveniently take a step back from asserting their style of legal formalism, and allow their colleagues from America's current version of [legal realism and instrumentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_formalism#Comparison_to_legal_instrumentalism) to take center stage, for arguing that historical connotations do need to be taken into consideration, particularly when the topic of discussion is about defining the maritime borders of the People's Republic of China. 


>The US in the meantime, is encouraging Taiwan to purchase "use-and-throw weaponry", instead of anything substantial that could be captured and reverse engineered by the Chinese. There is also the typical distrust among American strategists of all their client-states, in the sense that, "What if American advanced military technologies were to be leaked to the Chinese, upon being sold to people [stationed] on Taipei." 
>
>Those military strategists might even try to justify their need to withhold trust, in their clients, by suggesting how previously sold defense systems to Taiwan were soon afterwards found to be replicated by the People's Liberation Army. And more specifically because, how can anybody be certain whether people living on that island are, or are not, Chinese to begin with?

American government's approach to international relationships has remained the same as it was, during and prior to the US-Russia Cold War era, which has been to sow seeds of discord and doubt among America's non-allies, and often, even among allies to keep them in a subordinate position via "information-asymmetry." The main purpose of that approach has been to increase chaos and confusion among nations of the world to keep them divided; and to "reserve 'the right'" to play whichever card that the American agencies may feel like playing, whenever it suits them, particularly for gaining undue and unearned advantages, even if those cards are irreconcilably opposed and contradictory to humanity's sustainability. Being sneaky, dishonest, underhanded, insincere, surreptitious, divisive, disingenuous, dastardly, and conniving, while bending and breaking 'the international rules of the game', and also by simultaneously putting into effect any strategy or tactic, which would otherwise be hypocritical and wrongful of all other nations to use, is the only demonstrably consistent reality of the American government's conduct in various matters concerning the wellness of humanity as a whole, and of life's global ecology. 

Such ignoble and unjust pursuits and behaviors driven by insatiable greed, among various educational, religious, industrial, and socio-political leaders from North America, that have continuously produced inter-generational harms against a greater majority of the world's nations, has been especially to the detriment of all civilizations that are not: Euro-centric and subservient to Anglo-Saxon worldviews. 

The most important time for America's people to introspect and reflect upon, in order to suitably change and depart from the illegitimate, degrading, and dishonorable things that a number of their current and previous office bearers, and thought leaders from government as well as non-government organizations have wreaked upon the world, is now.

### Now, let's get meta with this article 

The following type of results can be obtained, if you feed the last three paragraphs of the above text as a document for content and sentiment analysis, into a commercial AI software like: 

- IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding 

    - It finds the document's sentiment to be significantly positive, and you might be surprised by what kinds of phrases and sentences it seems to find positive. I certainly was. 
	
	- For sentiment analysis of a given text, the score is from -1 to 1.
	
	```
	{
	  "sentiment": {
		"document": {
		  "score": 0.433172,
		  "mixed": "1",
		  "label": "positive"
		}
	  }
	}
	```
	
    - Category label scores of a given text are from 0 to 1.
    - The category labels ascribed to given text are: 
    
    ```
	{
	  "categories": [
		{
		  "score": 0.867021,
		  "label": "/news and politics/politics"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.821197,
		  "label": "/news and politics/politics/political issues"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.708663,
		  "label": "/news and politics/politics/war and conflicts"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.682005,
		  "label": "/business and finance/economy/financial reform"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.652868,
		  "label": "/news and politics/international news"
		},
		{
		  "score": 0.582426,
		  "label": "/news and politics/law"
		}
	  ]
	}
	```

- Google Natural Language API V2

    - It finds the document's sentiment to be strongly negative (very close to maximum negative score), and I was a bit surprised by how drastically negative it scored the given text. I couldn't figure out how to obtain the json format of its analytical outputs, but this is what it provided: 
	
	- Entire Document's Sentiment: 
	
	  - Score = -0.934 && Magnitude = 3.944
	  
	  - "Score" is supposed to be from -1 to +1 while "Magnitude" is from 0 to +inf. 
	
	- Categories: 
	
	  - "/People & Society/Social Sciences/Political Science" && Score = 0.8092402
	  
	  - "/Law & Government/Government/Other" && Score = 0.1703827
	  
	  - "/News/Politics/Other" && Score: 0.11693627
	  
	  - Here the score for categorizing a given text is from 0 to 1.


All of the above scores among both AI, signify a statistical confidence level, and there is no easy way to decide what level of precision after the decimal point on those numerical values actually matters in terms of statistical sensitivity and physical meaningfulness. 

I, as the author though, would say that this is my writing style where I intend to be neutral, by positing opinions which naturally sound negatively valanced about "various but not all" American states-persons, as a critique of their publicly apparent conduct; to then make a closing statement in the final paragraph that sounds more positive and hopeful. 

The last three paragraphs of this article's main content can also be obtained as a URL, to feed it to an AI in plain text - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callthis/fiction/master/meta/america-taiwan-relations-question-mark.txt 

So, comparing the two commercial AI, I would say that IBM Watson does a better job at finding the intended category labels; whereas Google's Natural Language API didn't detect the topics of "war and conflict" as well as "financial reform" (or more accurately, political reform). And both of those AI models failed to identify the category of "International Affairs." 

Unfortunately, popular AI have not yet been trained to detect content that is supposed to be humorous or sarcastic, within a given content's tone and sentiment, which would be a more fine-grained analysis than simplistic labels of "positive vs negative." However, I would say that both IBM's and Google's AI missed the mark on labeling the content as neutral, or slightly negative. Of course, by no means was this article's content about positively praising, any particular entity. For sure! LOL :laughing:  


#### 27-09-2025 | Updated comparison with ChatGPT:

- Prompt: 

	Summarize and produce a sentiment analysis of the following three paragraphs

- ChatGPT Reply: 

	Sure! Please go ahead and provide the three paragraphs you'd like me to summarize and analyze.

- Prompt:

	[text of the last three paragraphs of the main article herein.] 
	
- ChatGPT Reply: 

	*Summary:*

	The three paragraphs describe a critical perspective on the U.S. government's foreign policy, particularly focusing on its historical approach to international relations. The author argues that the U.S. has consistently used tactics of sowing discord and manipulating information to maintain global dominance, often contradicting international norms and undermining global cooperation. The text emphasizes how this strategy has been driven by greed and serves the interests of an Anglo-Saxon, Euro-centric worldview, often at the expense of other civilizations. The author calls for introspection and a change in the behavior of U.S. leaders to address the harm caused by these actions.

	*Sentiment Analysis:*

	Polarity: -0.75 (Negative sentiment)

	Subjectivity: 0.85 (High subjectivity)

	The sentiment of the text is overwhelmingly negative. It criticizes the U.S. government’s approach to foreign policy, accusing it of dishonesty, manipulation, and selfishness. The tone is harsh and condemning, with a strong focus on the harmful impact of American actions on global relations. The subjectivity is high, as the text conveys personal opinions and judgments about U.S. behavior rather than presenting objective facts.

	Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular section or provide more details on the analysis?
	
- LOLs

	ChatGPT finds the article "overwhelmingly negative." It was mostly intended to be sarcastic and not scornful, and it was definitely not intended to be modest or "objective" but, I can understand where ChatGPT is coming from. 
	
- Prompt: 

	What would make it more objective? 
	
- ChatGPT Reply:

	To make the text more objective, the tone and content would need to shift away from emotional language and subjective judgment, focusing instead on verifiable facts, clear explanations, and neutral language. Here are some specific suggestions to improve objectivity:

	1. **Remove Emotional and Judgmental Language**:

	The text uses strong, emotionally charged terms like "sneaky," "dishonest," "dastardly," "underhanded," "hypocritical," etc. These words convey a personal judgment of the U.S. government's actions. Replacing these with more neutral terms (e.g., "deceptive tactics," "contradictory actions") would help create a more neutral tone.

	**Example:**

	* Original: "Being sneaky, dishonest, underhanded, insincere, surreptitious..."
	* Revised: "Engaging in covert or deceptive tactics, undermining transparency..."

	2. **Provide Factual Evidence**:

	Statements like "The American government's approach... has remained the same" and "Such ignoble and unjust pursuits..." would be more objective if they were supported by specific historical examples or data. Instead of making broad claims, citing instances where U.S. foreign policy has caused harm, or referencing studies and reports, would lend more credibility and objectivity.

	**Example:**

	* Original: "The main purpose of that approach has been to increase chaos and confusion among nations..."
	* Revised: "Critics of U.S. foreign policy have argued that certain strategies, such as information warfare, have led to instability in regions like the Middle East."

	3. **Avoid Overgeneralizations**:

	Statements like "all civilizations that are not Euro-centric" or "a number of their current and previous office bearers" are broad generalizations that don’t leave room for nuance. Instead, providing specific examples or acknowledging counterarguments would help balance the narrative and avoid sweeping claims.

	**Example:**

	* Original: "has been especially to the detriment of all civilizations that are not Euro-centric and subservient to Anglo-Saxon worldviews."
	* Revised: "Critics argue that U.S. foreign policy has often favored Euro-centric or Western viewpoints, sometimes at the expense of non-Western nations."

	4. **Eliminate Ambiguity**:

	The phrase "the American government's conduct in various matters concerning the wellness of humanity" is vague and could be made more precise. Instead of using broad terms like "wellness of humanity," it would be clearer to focus on specific global issues, such as environmental sustainability, economic inequality, or peace-building, and explain how the U.S. government’s actions have impacted those areas.

	**Example:**

	* Original: "the wellness of humanity as a whole, and of life's global ecology."
	* Revised: "the global environment and international relations, particularly in regions affected by U.S. foreign interventions."

	5. **Maintain a Balanced Tone**:

	Introducing more balance would involve acknowledging the complexity of international relations and the role of various actors. For example, recognizing that the U.S. government has had both positive and negative effects in different parts of the world could provide a more balanced view.

	**Example:**

	* Original: "Such ignoble and unjust pursuits..."
	* Revised: "There are critiques of U.S. foreign policy, particularly regarding its impact on non-Western nations, though others argue that these actions have been in the pursuit of national security or global stability."

	--

	**Revised Objective Version:**

	The U.S. government’s approach to international relations has been criticized for using tactics that sometimes create division among nations. Historically, this approach has been characterized by the manipulation of information to maintain influence and control over both allies and non-allies. This strategy, often seen in Cold War-era policies, has led some to argue that it undermines international cooperation and stability. Critics claim that such actions have disproportionately impacted nations outside of the Eurocentric sphere, contributing to long-term political and economic harm in certain regions.

	While some argue that these tactics are part of a broader strategy to maintain global influence, others believe they perpetuate systemic inequalities. The question of how to address these issues is pressing, with many suggesting that the U.S. must reassess its foreign policy approach to ensure it aligns with international norms and supports global peace and sustainability.

	--

	By focusing on presenting facts, reducing emotional language, and acknowledging complexity, the revised version becomes more neutral, balanced, and objective.

- Holy Cow!

	LLMs have become maverick writers and editors merely within one year! IBM's Watson seems too robotic compared to currently available Generative AI Models. Let's see what ChatGPT says about such an opinion. 
	
	
- Prompt: 

	Is the currently available version of IBM Watson obsolete, compared to latest version of ChatGPT?  

	
- ChatGPT Reply: 

	*[After loads of info about each platform's features compared side-by-side...]*
	
	**Conclusion: Is IBM Watson Obsolete Compared to ChatGPT?**
	
	No, IBM Watson is not obsolete compared to ChatGPT, but they serve different niches. IBM Watson remains a powerful AI platform, especially for enterprise-level applications that require structured data analysis, security, and compliance in industries like healthcare and finance. On the other hand, ChatGPT (GPT-4) excels at conversational AI, general-purpose language generation, and more human-like interactions.

	If your goal is to implement advanced, nuanced conversations or creative content generation, GPT-4 is likely the better choice. However, for highly structured and regulated environments, Watson may still be more suitable due to its customization and enterprise-level features.

	Would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspects of either platform?
