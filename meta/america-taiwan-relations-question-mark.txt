American government's approach to international relationships has remained the same as it was, during and prior to the US-Russia Cold War era, which has been to sow seeds of discord and doubt among America's non-allies, and often, even among allies to keep them in a subordinate position via "information asymmetry." The main purpose of that approach has been to increase chaos and confusion among nations of the world to keep them divided; and to "reserve 'the right'" to play whichever card that the American agencies may feel like playing, whenever it suits them, particularly for gaining undue and unearned advantages, even if those cards are irreconcilably opposed and contradictory. Being sneaky, dishonest, underhanded, insincere, surreptitious, divisive, disingenuous, dastardly, and conniving, while bending and breaking 'the international rules of the game', by simultaneously putting into effect any strategy or tactic, which would otherwise be hypocritical and wrongful of all other nations to use, is the only demonstrably consistent reality of the American government's conduct in various matters concerning the wellness of humanity as a whole, and of life's global ecology.

Such ignoble and unjust behaviors driven by greed among various educational, religious, industrial, and socio-political leaders from North America, which have continuously produced inter-generational harms against a greater majority of the world's nations, has been especially to the detriment of all civilizations that are not: Euro-centric and subservient to Anglo-Saxon worldviews.

The most important time for America's people to introspect and reflect upon, in order to suitably change and depart from the illegitimate, degrading, and dishonorable things that a number of their current and previous office bearers, and thought leaders from government as well as non-government organizations have wreaked upon the world, is now.
