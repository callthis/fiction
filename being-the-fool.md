## Being The Fool

One way to overload an agent who is monitoring a target person's online activities, is for that person to fill up most of the day, as well as most of the days of the week, with activities such as watching gruesome horror movies, reading dreary news articles, or jerking-off to as weird but legal pornography as possible. The agents, including those working in shifts, eventually, only remember the things that were "morally objectionable" from their viewpoint and sensibilities, and strangely, don't remember anything the monitored person did or didn't do, that could have been an act of signaling or messaging to a "home base" or to a "third party."  

>This particular documentary about moderators experiencing burnout while tasked with censoring online content on Facebook, is drastically close to the types of human factors issues that surveillance agents face on a regular basis, when tasked with monitoring a target person - [The Horrors of Being a Facebook Moderator | Informer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHGbWn6iwHw) (Viewer discretion advised).  

Typically, the most morally objectionable or disgusting things that become seared into the memories of a surveillance agent, are things such as sexual fetishes within pornographic online content or within on-ground physical activities involving amputees, little persons, transsexual gendered and-or homosexual people, and so on and so forth. More often than not, the monitoring agents tend to look for any type of morally or ethically objectionable activity involving financial transactions, substance abuse, domestic violence, or sexual orientation of the "suspicious person", which they can then use for portraying that person as an "irredeemable reprobate", in the eyes of their agency's colleagues and superiors. 

Finding actually illegal activities being done by a suspect that can be presented to a court, is often too time consuming or simply infeasible, because those activities either don't exist, or simply aren't observed during rounds of surveillance. So, various security and law enforcement agents do tend to gin up a sense of fear, anger, or disgust among supervisory authority figures via their reports filed against the monitored person(s), using one or the other "quirky" behavior seen in the individual's or group's outlook or activities, as a "symptom", of something that is, or can potentially be, pathologized or criminalized. This way, more invasive or forceful actions can then be directed at the person(s) being monitored using authorized or "off-the-books" operations, while comfortably feeling righteous and morally superior, in carrying out those types of wasteful and illegitimate enforcement directives.   

Now, *you* wouldn't ever suspect me of deliberately doing things like, 

  - falling down in public, at least three times a day,

  - acting like a clumsy autistic nitwit,
  
  - slacking-off throughout the day,
  
  - and taking a dump, out in the open street, at least once a month, 
 
would you?
